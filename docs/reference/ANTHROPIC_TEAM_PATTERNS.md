### Product Development Team

**Context**: Feature development, UI/UX implementation, and user-facing functionality

#### Core Patterns
- **Auto-Accept Mode for Peripherals**: Non-core features run autonomously
- **Vim Mode Integration**: Seamless editor integration for rapid iteration
- **Component-First Development**: Building reusable components before features

#### Workflow Example
```bash
# Auto-accept for styling and minor features
claude-code --auto-accept --scope "styling,docs,tests"

# Synchronous for core business logic
claude-code --sync --scope "auth,payments,core-api"
```

#### Configuration Pattern
```markdown
# .claude/CLAUDE.md
## Auto-Accept Rules
- CSS/styling changes: AUTO
- Documentation updates: AUTO
- Unit tests: AUTO
- Core business logic: MANUAL
- Authentication: MANUAL
- Payment processing: MANUAL
```

#### Success Metrics

- **GitHub Integration**: Design changes tracked in version control
- **Component Library Management**: Automated design system updates

#### Visual Workflow
```bash
# Design iteration cycle
1. Take screenshot of current state
2. Describe desired changes in natural language
3. Claude Code implements changes
4. Take new screenshot for comparison
5. Iterate until perfect
```

#### GitHub Integration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/design-review.yml
name: Design Review
on:
  pull_request:
    paths: ['src/components/**', 'src/styles/**']
jobs:
  visual-diff:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Generate Visual Diff
        run: claude-code --visual-diff --pr ${{ github.event.number }}
```

#### Impact Metrics
- 50% faster design iteration
- 95% reduction in design-dev handoff issues
- 100% design system consistency

---

## Universal Best Practices

### The "Slot Machine" Approach

**Pattern**: Commit current work, run Claude Code for 30 minutes, then decide to accept or restart

#### Implementation
```bash
# Save current state
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: before claude session"

# Run focused 30-minute session
claude-code --timer 30min --scope "specific-feature"

# Decision point
if [success]; then
    git add . && git commit -m "feat: completed with claude assistance"
else
    git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Reset to checkpoint
fi
```

#### Why It Works
- Prevents endless iteration cycles
- Creates natural decision points
- Maintains code quality standards
- Reduces cognitive load

---

### Auto-Accept vs Synchronous Decision Matrix

| Task Type | Mode | Reasoning |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Core Business Logic | Synchronous | Requires human oversight |
| Authentication/Security | Synchronous | Critical security implications |
| Payment Processing | Synchronous | Financial risk considerations |
| UI/UX Styling | Auto-Accept | Low risk, high iteration benefit |
| Documentation | Auto-Accept | Easy to review and fix |
| Unit Tests | Auto-Accept | Test failures will catch issues |
| Configuration Files | Synchronous | System stability implications |
| API Integrations | Synchronous | External dependency risks |

#### Configuration Example
```markdown
# .claude/CLAUDE.md
## Auto-Accept Rules
AUTO_ACCEPT_PATTERNS:
  - "src/styles/**"
  - "docs/**"
  - "tests/unit/**"
  - "*.md"

MANUAL_REVIEW_PATTERNS:
  - "src/auth/**"
  - "src/payments/**"
  - "config/**"
  - "src/api/**"
```

---

### Custom CLAUDE.md Instructions

**Purpose**: Prevent repeated mistakes and encode team-specific knowledge

#### Anti-Pattern Prevention
```markdown
# .claude/CLAUDE.md
## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- NEVER use `any` type in TypeScript
- ALWAYS add error handling to API calls
- NEVER commit console.log statements
- ALWAYS update tests when changing interfaces
- NEVER hardcode API endpoints

## Project-Specific Rules
- Use Tailwind CSS classes, not custom CSS
- All API calls must include timeout configuration
- Database queries must include proper indexing hints
- All forms must include validation and error states
```

#### Team Standards
```markdown
## Code Style Enforcement
- Use ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Follow conventional commit format
- Include type definitions for all functions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use semantic versioning for releases
```

---

### Checkpoint-Heavy Workflow

**Pattern**: Frequent commits create safety nets for experimentation

#### Checkpoint Strategy
```bash
# Before starting any change
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: starting feature X"

# After each significant change
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: implemented component Y"

# Before risky refactoring
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: before refactoring Z"

# Final commit
git add . && git commit -m "feat: completed feature X with claude assistance"
```

#### Automated Checkpoints
```bash
# Git hook for automatic checkpoints
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-claude
git add . && git commit -m "auto-checkpoint: $(date)"
```

---

### Visual-First Development

**Pattern**: Screenshots drive all UI/UX decisions

#### Workflow Steps
1. **Capture Current State**: Screenshot before changes
2. **Describe Vision**: Natural language description of desired outcome
3. **Implement Changes**: Claude Code makes modifications
4. **Verify Results**: Screenshot after changes
5. **Compare and Iterate**: Side-by-side comparison

#### Tool Integration
```bash
# Automated screenshot comparison
claude-code --visual-mode --compare-screenshots \
  --before current-state.png \
  --after target-design.png
```

---

## Non-Developer Enablement

### Plain Text Workflow Descriptions

**Target Users**: Product managers, designers, marketers, analysts

#### Example: Marketing Campaign Setup
```markdown
## Campaign Creation Workflow

1. "Create a new email campaign for product launch"
2. "Set up A/B testing with two subject line variants"
3. "Configure send time optimization for different time zones"
4. "Add tracking pixels for conversion measurement"
5. "Schedule campaign for next Tuesday at 9 AM EST"
```

#### Translation to Code
Claude Code interprets these requirements and:
- Creates campaign configuration files
- Sets up A/B testing infrastructure
- Configures analytics tracking
- Schedules deployment

---

### Visual Prototyping Patterns

**Use Case**: Rapid UI mockup creation without coding knowledge

#### Natural Language UI Description
```markdown
## Dashboard Layout Request

"Create a dashboard with:
- Header with company logo and user profile menu
- Sidebar with navigation for Reports, Analytics, Settings
- Main content area with 3 cards showing KPIs
- Each card has a number, label, and trend indicator
- Footer with copyright and help links
- Use blue color scheme matching our brand"
```

#### Generated Output
- Complete HTML/CSS implementation
- Responsive design
- Interactive elements
- Brand-consistent styling

---

### API-Enabled Repetitive Task Automation

**Pattern**: Automate recurring workflows without programming

#### Example: Social Media Management
```markdown
## Daily Social Media Workflow

"Every morning at 8 AM:
1. Check trending topics in our industry
2. Create 3 social media posts based on trends
3. Schedule posts across Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook
4. Generate analytics report from yesterday's posts
5. Send summary email to marketing team"
```

#### Implementation
```python
# Claude Code generates this automation
def daily_social_workflow():
    trends = get_trending_topics()
    posts = generate_posts_from_trends(trends)
    schedule_across_platforms(posts)
    analytics = generate_analytics_report()
    send_team_summary(analytics)
```

---

### Breaking Complex Workflows into Specialized Sub-Agents

**Strategy**: Divide complex processes into focused, manageable agents

#### E-commerce Order Processing Example
```bash
# Inventory management agent
claude-code --agent inventory --focus "stock-levels,reordering"

# Customer service agent
claude-code --agent support --focus "tickets,responses,escalations"

# Shipping agent
claude-code --agent shipping --focus "tracking,logistics,delivery"

# Analytics agent
claude-code --agent analytics --focus "sales-reports,trends,forecasting"
```

#### Cross-Agent Communication
```yaml
# agent-coordination.yml
workflows:
  order_processing:
    steps:
      - agent: inventory
        action: check_stock
      - agent: shipping
        action: calculate_costs
      - agent: support
        action: send_confirmation
      - agent: analytics
        action: update_metrics
```
