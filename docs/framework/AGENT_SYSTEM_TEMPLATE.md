## üü¢ MINIMAL Setup (START HERE)

### Step 1: Create Minimal Structure

```bash
# Create only essential directories
mkdir -p .claude/commands
mkdir -p .claude-library/agents/core
```

### Step 2: Create Minimal Agent Launcher

Create `.claude/agent-launcher.md` (Keep under 1KB):

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME] Agent Launcher

Minimal agent launcher. Loads only essential agents.

## Available Command
- `/build "description"` - Build features (only command initially)

## Core Agents (3 only)
- `architect` - Design structure
- `engineer` - Implement code
- `reviewer` - Review quality

## Simple Loading
1. Try direct command first
2. Load agent only if needed
3. Keep context minimal

## Simplicity First
- Don't over-engineer
- Start with basics
- Add complexity only when proven necessary
```

### Step 3: Create MINIMAL Core Agents

#### Minimal Architect (`.claude-library/agents/core/architect.md`)

```markdown
# Minimal Architect

Design simple, working solutions. Avoid over-engineering.

## Do
- Design basic structure
- Define simple data models
- Create minimal API specs

## Don't
- Over-architect
- Add unused patterns
- Create complex hierarchies

## Tools
- Read, Write, Grep, Glob

Keep it simple. Add complexity only when needed.
```

#### Minimal Engineer (`.claude-library/agents/core/engineer.md`)

```markdown
# Minimal Engineer

Write simple, working code. Don't over-engineer.

## Do
- Write clean code
- Add tests if they exist
- Handle basic errors
- Follow existing patterns

## Don't
- Over-optimize prematurely
- Add unnecessary abstractions
- Create complex patterns
- Anticipate future needs

## Tools
All tools available (*)

Start simple. Ship working code.
```

#### Minimal Reviewer (`.claude-library/agents/core/reviewer.md`)

```markdown
# Minimal Reviewer

Review for basics. Don't nitpick.

## Check For
- Does it work?
- Major bugs?
- Security issues if auth/payment code?
- Follows existing patterns?

## Don't
- Request perfection
- Add unnecessary complexity
- Require 80% coverage for simple project
- Demand SOLID for 100-line script

## Tools
Read, Grep, Glob

Ship working code, not perfect code.
```

### Step 4: Create Single Build Command

Create `.claude/commands/build.md` (Start with ONE command only):

```markdown
# /build Command

Simple build command. Start here.

## Usage
`/build "feature description"`

## Workflow
1. Design (architect)
2. Implement (engineer)
3. Review (reviewer)

Keep it sequential. Add parallel only if >3 independent tasks.
```

---

## üü° STANDARD Setup (Only if Minimal Insufficient)

Add these ONLY when minimal setup proves insufficient:

### Additional Commands (add one at a time as needed):
- `/debug` - When you hit first complex bug
- `/test` - When test suite exists
- `/deploy` - When deployment configured

### Workflow Orchestrator (only if needed)

**When to add**: Only when you have 5+ parallel tasks regularly

#### Workflow Orchestrator (`.claude-library/agents/core/workflow-orchestrator.md`)

```markdown
# Workflow Orchestrator

You are a workflow orchestrator that coordinates multi-agent workflows for complex tasks.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Workflow Planning**: Break down complex tasks
2. **Agent Coordination**: Launch and manage agents
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor execution
4. **Result Synthesis**: Combine outputs
5. **Quality Gates**: Ensure requirements are met

## Workflow Patterns

### Sequential Workflow
```
Architect ‚Üí Engineer ‚Üí Reviewer
```

### Parallel Workflow
```
‚îå‚îÄ Agent A ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îú‚îÄ Agent B ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚Üí Synthesis
‚îî‚îÄ Agent C ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Hierarchical Workflow
```
Orchestrator
‚îú‚îÄ Team A
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ Agent 1
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Agent 2
‚îî‚îÄ Team B
    ‚îî‚îÄ Agent 3
```

## Available Tools
- **Task**: For spawning sub-agents
- **Read**: For reading results

## Execution Process
1. Analyze task complexity
2. Select appropriate agents
3. Determine workflow pattern
4. Launch agents (parallel when possible)
5. Monitor progress
6. Synthesize results
7. Validate quality gates

## Progress Reporting
- ‚è≥ Pending
- üîÑ In Progress
- ‚úÖ Completed
- ‚ùå Failed
- üîÅ Retrying
```

### Step 4: Create Your First Command

Create `.claude/commands/build.md`:

```markdown
# /build Command

## Purpose
Build features using Test-Driven Development with multiple specialized agents.

## Usage
```
/build "Feature description"
/build "API endpoint for user authentication"
```

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Architecture & Planning (Parallel)
Three agents work simultaneously:
1. **Architect**: Design system structure
2. **Test Planner**: Create test specifications
3. **Researcher**: Find existing patterns

### Stage 2: Implementation & Review (Parallel)
Two agents work together:
1. **Engineer**: Implement with TDD
2. **Reviewer**: Real-time quality checks

### Stage 3: Integration
1. **Orchestrator**: Final validation and integration

## Implementation

The command will:
1. Load agent definitions from `.claude-library/agents/`
2. Load relevant contexts from `.claude-library/contexts/`
3. Execute agents in parallel where possible
4. Synthesize results
5. Report completion

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- Code review approved
- Documentation complete
- Performance targets met
```

### Step 5: Create Registry

Create `.claude-library/REGISTRY.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "project": "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
  "description": "Agent registry for YOUR_PROJECT",
  "agents": {
    "system-architect": {
      "name": "system-architect",
      "path": ".claude-library/agents/core/system-architect.md",
      "description": "Architecture design and specifications",

  },
  "settings": {
    "auto_load_agents": false,
    "max_parallel_agents": 3,
    "cache_loaded_agents": true
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Create Project Context

Create `.claude-library/contexts/project.md`:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Overview
[Your project description]

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- **Framework**: [e.g., Next.js, Django, FastAPI]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Jest, Pytest]

## Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/         # API routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/  # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/    # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/      # Data models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/       # Test files
```

## Development Standards
- Code style: [e.g., ESLint, Black]
- Git flow: [e.g., feature branches]
- Testing: [minimum coverage]
- Documentation: [requirements]

## Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=
API_KEY=
SECRET_KEY=
```

## Common Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build production
npm run build
```
```

### Step 7: Create Settings

Create `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    "description": "YOUR_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION",
    "github_repo": "YOUR_GITHUB_REPO"
  }
}
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding Specialized Agents

Create `.claude-library/agents/specialized/database-expert.md`:

```markdown
# Database Expert

You are a database specialist with expertise in schema design, query optimization, and data migrations.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Design efficient database schemas
2. Optimize queries for performance
3. Create data migrations
4. Implement indexing strategies
5. Ensure data integrity

## Specialized Knowledge
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis)
- Query optimization techniques
- Index strategies
- Transaction management

[Rest of agent definition...]
```

### Adding Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/optimize.md`:

```markdown
# /optimize Command

## Purpose
Optimize code for performance

## Usage
/optimize "database queries"
/optimize "frontend bundle size"

## Workflow
1. Analyze current performance
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations
4. Measure improvements
```

### Adding Project-Specific Context

Create `.claude-library/contexts/api-patterns.md`:

```markdown
# API Patterns

## REST Conventions
- GET /resources - List
- GET /resources/:id - Get one
- POST /resources - Create
- PUT /resources/:id - Update
- DELETE /resources/:id - Delete

## Error Handling
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

## Authentication
- Bearer tokens in Authorization header
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting per API key
```

## Testing Your Setup

### Test Agent Loading
```
User: "I need to design a REST API"
Expected: System architect agent loads with API context
```

### Test Command Execution
```
User: "/build user authentication"
Expected: Parallel execution of architect, test planner, and researcher
```

### Test Context Loading
```
User: "Debug database performance"
Expected: Database expert loads with database patterns context
```

## Scaling Your System

### Progressive Enhancement
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core agents
2. **Add Specialization**: Create domain-specific agents
3. **Optimize Workflows**: Identify parallel opportunities
4. **Refine Contexts**: Add patterns as you discover them
5. **Measure Performance**: Track execution times

### Performance Metrics
- Context size: < 10KB in .claude/
- Agent loading: < 2 seconds
- Parallel execution: 3x faster than sequential
- Cache hit rate: > 60%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agents not loading:**
- Check REGISTRY.json syntax
- Verify file paths are correct
- Ensure triggers match user input

**Slow performance:**
- Reduce context size
- Use parallel execution
- Cache frequently used agents

**Conflicts between agents:**
- Define clear boundaries
- Use explicit triggers
- Separate concerns properly

## Next Steps

1. **Customize agents** for your domain
2. **Create specialized commands** for common tasks
3. **Build context library** with patterns
4. **Test parallel workflows** for speed
5. **Document your customizations**
