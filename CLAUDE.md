# CLAUDE.md - Network Engineering Edition

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the Network Engineering branch of the Claude Agent Framework.

## Project Overview

This is the **Network Engineering Edition** of the Claude Agent Framework - a specialized branch containing pre-built AI agents for Cisco network infrastructure management. Unlike the general framework (which builds custom agents), this edition provides ready-to-use specialists for ISE, VoIP, pyATS, and network automation workflows.

## ðŸŽ¯ PRIMARY PRINCIPLE: Simplicity First, Even with Pre-Built Tools

**CRITICAL**: Always try simple approaches before using agents. The tools are powerful but should complement, not replace, fundamental troubleshooting skills.

**ESCALATION PATH**: Basic Commands â†’ Scripts â†’ Single Agent â†’ Multi-Agent Coordination

**FOCUS**: This branch provides specialized, enterprise-ready agents for network infrastructure operations. Start simple, use agents when complexity is justified.

## Recommended Workflows for Network Engineers

### **New User Onboarding**

1. **Start Here**: Read [`README.md`](README.md) for overview and quick start
2. **Choose Your Path**:
   - ISE Engineers â†’ [`docs/network-engineering/ISE_TOOLKIT_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/network-engineering/ISE_TOOLKIT_INTEGRATION.md)
   - VoIP Engineers â†’ [`docs/network-engineering/VOIP_WIRESHARK_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/network-engineering/VOIP_WIRESHARK_INTEGRATION.md)
   - Automation Engineers â†’ [`docs/network-engineering/PYATS_FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md`](docs/network-engineering/PYATS_FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md)
3. **Try Basic Commands**: Use toolkit commands for your specific domain
4. **Explore Advanced Features**: Review examples and integration patterns

### **Daily Operations Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start with basic health checks
ping critical-devices.txt
show commands on problem devices

# 2. Use automation for routine monitoring
python scripts/pyats_launcher.py run-health-check infrastructure.yaml

# 3. Escalate to agents only for complex issues
/ise-toolkit auth-troubleshoot "authentication-failures"  # When basic auth fails
/voip-toolkit call-quality-analysis "poor-audio-reports"  # When voice metrics show issues

# 4. Research improvements for preventing issues
/claude-docs best-practices "simple-monitoring-approaches"

# Remember: Agents should make simple tasks faster, not replace basic skills
```

### **Incident Response Workflow**

```bash
# Step 1: Quick assessment with appropriate specialist
/ise-toolkit performance-monitor "system-slowdown"

# Step 2: Deep dive analysis with supporting agents
# (ISE Specialist coordinates with Authentication Analyzer)

# Step 3: Generate comprehensive incident report
# (Agents provide root cause analysis and remediation steps)

# Step 4: Implement fixes and validate
python scripts/pyats_launcher.py state-comparison testbed.yaml

# Step 5: Update documentation and preventive measures
/claude-docs architecture "improved-monitoring-strategy"
```
