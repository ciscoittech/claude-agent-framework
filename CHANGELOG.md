### Technical Details
- **Files Created**: 1
  - MULTI_MODEL_ROUTING.md (850+ lines)

- **Files Modified**: 2
  - README.md (+14 lines - cost optimization section)
  - CHANGELOG.md (this entry)

- **External Dependencies**:
  - claude-code-router (npm package)
  - OpenRouter API account (free tier available)

### Validation
- **Router Installation**: âœ… Verified on macOS
- **Configuration**: âœ… Tested with Qwen3 models
- **API Integration**: âœ… OpenRouter connectivity confirmed
- **Server Status**: âœ… Running on port 3456

### Breaking Changes
- None. Multi-model routing is completely optional.
- Framework works identically without router installed.
- Existing agent systems unaffected.

### Migration Guide
**Optional Enhancement** - No migration required:
1. Install claude-code-router: `npm install -g @musistudio/claude-code-router`
2. Configure models in `~/.claude-code-router/config.json`
3. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable
4. Start router: `ccr start`
5. Optionally update REGISTRY.json with model preferences

### Best Practices
- Start conservative (powerful models), optimize incrementally
- Monitor quality vs. cost trade-offs
- Use code-specialized models (Qwen3 Coder) for code tasks
- Reserve thinking models for complex reasoning
- Track costs with observability integration

### Future Enhancements
- Auto-model selection based on task complexity analysis
- Real-time cost dashboard
- A/B testing for model performance comparison
- Smart fallbacks with automatic model upgrade on failure
