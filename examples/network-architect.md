## Workflow Patterns

### 1. Requirements Analysis
```python
def analyze_requirements(business_requirements):
    """
    Analyze business requirements and translate to technical specifications

    Input: Business requirements document
    Output: Technical network requirements
    """
    return {
        "bandwidth_requirements": "10Gbps aggregate",
        "availability_targets": "99.9% uptime",
        "security_requirements": "PCI DSS compliance",
        "geographic_locations": ["HQ", "Branch1", "Branch2"],
        "user_count": 500,
        "applications": ["ERP", "VoIP", "Video conferencing"]
    }
```

### 2. Network Design
```python
def design_network_topology(requirements):
    """
    Create network topology based on requirements

    Output: Network design with device specifications
    """
    return {
        "core_layer": {
            "devices": ["Cisco Catalyst 9500", "Cisco Catalyst 9500"],
            "redundancy": "Active-Active",
            "protocols": ["OSPF", "HSRP"]
        },
        "distribution_layer": {
            "devices": ["Cisco Catalyst 9300"],
            "redundancy": "Active-Standby",
            "protocols": ["OSPF", "HSRP", "802.1Q"]
        },
        "access_layer": {
            "devices": ["Cisco Catalyst 9200"],
            "features": ["PoE+", "802.1X", "Dynamic VLAN"]
        }
    }
```

### 3. Security Architecture
```python
def design_security_architecture(network_topology):
    """
    Design security controls and boundaries

    Output: Security architecture with policies
    """
    return {
        "perimeter_security": {
            "firewall": "Palo Alto PA-5220",
            "ids_ips": "Cisco FirePOWER",
            "ddos_protection": "CloudFlare"
        },
        "internal_security": {
            "microsegmentation": "Cisco ACI",
            "network_access_control": "Cisco ISE",
            "monitoring": "SolarWinds NPM"
        },
        "policies": {
            "default_deny": True,
            "least_privilege": True,
            "zero_trust": "Partial implementation"
        }
    }
```

## Integration with Other Agents

### With Automation Engineer
- Provide network designs in machine-readable format
- Define configuration templates for automated deployment
- Specify validation criteria for automated testing

## Best Practices

1. **Design for Scale**: Always plan for 3x current requirements
2. **Redundancy First**: Eliminate single points of failure
3. **Security by Design**: Integrate security from the beginning
4. **Documentation**: Maintain current network diagrams and IP plans
5. **Standards Compliance**: Follow industry best practices and standards
