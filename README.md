# 🌐 Claude Agent Framework - Network Engineering Edition

> **AI-Powered Network Infrastructure Management with Specialized Agent Systems**

Transform your network operations with expert-level troubleshooting, automation, and optimization through pre-built AI agents designed specifically for Cisco network infrastructures.

---

## 🎯 **Quick Start for Network Engineers**

⚠️ **SIMPLICITY FIRST**: Even with pre-built agents, start with basic commands before using complex multi-agent workflows. Try simple troubleshooting first, escalate to agents only when needed.

This branch provides ready-to-use specialized agents for network infrastructure management. Unlike the general framework (which builds custom agents), this edition includes pre-built experts for:

- **🔧 Cisco ISE**: Authentication troubleshooting, policy validation, RADIUS analysis
- **📞 VoIP Systems**: Call quality analysis, CUCM integration, SIP diagnostics
- **🤖 Network Automation**: pyATS integration, health monitoring, compliance checking
- **📚 Platform Research**: Real-time Claude Code documentation and best practices

### **⚡ 30-Second Setup**

```bash
# Clone network engineering branch
git clone -b network-engineering https://github.com/ciscoittech/claude-agent-framework.git
cd claude-agent-framework

# Initialize environment
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start using network agents
claude-code
```

### **🚀 Immediate Capabilities**

**Start Simple, Then Use Agents:**
```bash
# 1. Try basic troubleshooting first
ping device-ip
traceroute device-ip
show ip interface brief

# 2. Use agents for complex analysis when basic commands aren't enough
/ise-toolkit auth-troubleshoot "users-cannot-authenticate"
/voip-toolkit call-quality-analysis "poor-audio-complaints"

# 3. Use automation for repetitive tasks
python scripts/pyats_launcher.py run-health-check infrastructure.yaml

# 4. Research patterns for continuous improvement
/claude-docs best-practices "simple-troubleshooting-workflows"
```
