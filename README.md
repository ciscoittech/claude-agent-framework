## 🎯 What is Claude Agent Framework?

Claude Agent Framework is a battle-tested system that transforms Claude Code into a team of specialized AI agents working in parallel on your project. Whether you're building a startup MVP, enterprise system, or personal project, this framework adapts to YOUR stack and YOUR patterns.

**The Magic:** One prompt. Two minutes. Infinite possibilities.

---

## ⚡ The 2-Minute Setup

```bash
# In your project directory
$ claude

# Paste this:
"I want to set up Claude Agent Framework for my project.
Please read the SYSTEM_GENERATOR_PROMPT.md from ./claude-agent-framework/
and create my custom agent system."

# That's it. You're done. 🎉
```

Your custom agent team is now ready with:
- ✅ Agents that understand YOUR tech stack
- ✅ Commands tailored to YOUR workflow
- ✅ Patterns extracted from YOUR codebase
- ✅ Parallel execution for 3-6x speed boost

---

## 🚀 From Zero to Hero: Your Journey

## 🔍 Optional Patterns (NEW)

### Observability Pattern

Track your agent workflows with real-time monitoring:

```bash
# 1. Get free Logfire account
export LOGFIRE_TOKEN="your-key"

# 2. Enable in REGISTRY.json
"observability": { "enabled": true }

# 3. Watch your agents work
# View traces at your Logfire dashboard
```

**What you get:**
- 📊 Visual workflow traces (see agents working together)
- ✅ Automatic output validation (verify files created)
- 📈 Performance metrics (optimize your workflows)
- 🐛 Debug complex agent interactions

[Learn more →](./.claude-library/observability/README.md)

---

### Hooks Pattern (NEW)

Add deterministic control over your workflows:

```bash
# 1. Enable in REGISTRY.json
"hooks": { "enabled": true, "configs": ["code-quality.json"] }

# 2. Hooks run automatically
# - Auto-format code after changes
# - Block dangerous operations
# - Validate agent outputs
# - Send team notifications
```

**What you get:**
- 🛡️ Quality gates (auto-format, lint, test)
- 🔒 Security controls (block dangerous commands)
- 📢 Team notifications (Slack, Discord)
- 📊 Lightweight metrics (no external service)

[Learn more →](./.claude-library/hooks/README.md)
