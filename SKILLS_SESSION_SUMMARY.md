## Key Insights Discovered

### 1. Progressive Disclosure Revolution
Skills use a 3-tier progressive disclosure architecture:
- **Tier 1**: YAML metadata (30-50 words) loaded at startup
- **Tier 2**: SKILL.md body loaded when skill becomes relevant
- **Tier 3**: References/scripts loaded only when specific details needed

**Impact**: 70-90% reduction in unnecessary context vs traditional approach

### 2. Framework-Skills Synergy
Agent Skills are naturally aligned with framework design:
- **Framework strength**: Automatic agent selection
- **Skills strength**: Progressive disclosure and reusability
- **Combined**: Portable, efficient, composable expert system

### 3. Integration Opportunity Hierarchy
Five levels of integration, each adding value:

| Level | Skill Type | Timeline | Impact |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| **1** | Launcher | Week 1-2 | Setup speed 6x faster |
| **2** | Analyzer/Enforcer | Week 3-4 | Context 70% smaller |
| **3** | Generator | Week 5-6 | Token efficiency +40% |
| **4** | Compositions | Week 7-8 | Power multiplier 2-3x |
| **5** | Community | Week 9-16 | Ecosystem creation |

### 4. Backward Compatibility is Achievable
- No breaking changes required
- v1.0 and v1.1 can coexist
- Gradual migration path available
- Users can adopt at own pace

### 5. Setup Time Revolution
- **Current v1.0**: 45-60 minutes
- **With skills v1.1**: 5-10 minutes
- **Improvement**: 6-12x faster onboarding

## Architecture Highlights

### Progressive Disclosure Example

**Traditional Agent Loading** (100% context):
```
.claude/agents/code-specialist.json (Full config loaded)
├── Instructions (3KB)
├── Tools (2KB)
├── Context files (8KB)
└── Examples (2KB)
Total: ~15KB always loaded
```

**Skills Progressive Loading** (30% context):
```
Step 1: Load YAML metadata (500 bytes)
  → "Code generation and refactoring expert"
  → Claude decides: "This matches the task"

Step 2: Load SKILL.md body (2KB)
  → Full instructions available
  → Claude reads: "Now I understand what to do"

Step 3: Load references on demand (varies)
  → Only when specific examples needed
  → Reference.md: 2-4KB loaded as needed

Average context: ~2.5-5KB vs 15KB = 70-90% reduction
```

### Framework Integration Flow
