# /build-feature - Self-Building Feature Development

**Purpose**: Use Claude Agent Framework to build framework features using framework's own agents
**Agent**: framework-feature-builder (coordinator)
**Type**: Meta-Building Command
**Frequency**: On-demand when adding features

---

## Command Usage

```bash
/build-feature <feature_name> [--description "Feature description"] [--model opus|fable]
```

**Arguments**:
- `feature_name` (required): Name of the feature to build
- `--description` (optional): Detailed feature description
- `--model` (optional): Coordinator model. Defaults to `opus`.

**Examples**:
```bash
/build-feature task-validation
/build-feature performance-optimizer --description "Optimize agent execution speed"
/build-feature context-caching --description "Add context caching for faster loading"
/build-feature registry-v3 --model fable   # opt-in escalation, see below
```

---

## Model Selection

The coordinator runs on **`opus` at `xhigh` effort by default**. This is the right tier for
essentially every feature build — do not change it without a reason.

`--model fable` escalates **the coordinator only**. Use it when:
- The design phase has already failed on opus for this feature, or
- The feature spans >10 files or multiple subsystems and needs one coherent long-horizon plan.

**Cost of escalating**: Fable is $10/$50 per 1M tokens vs Opus at $5/$25 — 2x. Thinking is
always on (it cannot be disabled) and turns run substantially longer, so the real-world
multiple on a full build is higher than 2x, not lower.

**Hard constraint — the flag never propagates.** Every sub-agent launched in Phases 1-5 keeps
the model and effort assigned to it in `REGISTRY.json`, regardless of `--model`. A Fable
coordinator that spawned six Fable sub-agents would multiply the bill across the whole build
for no benefit: the sub-agents are doing bounded, well-specified work that opus and sonnet
already handle. When launching each sub-agent, pass its registry tier explicitly rather than
inheriting the coordinator's.

If a build is failing, try in this order before reaching for `--model fable`:
1. Tighten `--description` — most design-phase failures are underspecified requests.
2. Narrow the scope and build in two passes.
3. Then escalate.

## What This Command Does

This is **the most important command** in the framework - it proves the framework works by using itself to build itself.

**The Meta-Building Process**:
1. **Research Phase**: framework-research-specialist fetches relevant Claude Code patterns
2. **Design Phase**: framework-system-architect designs feature following best practices
3. **Implementation Phase**: framework-senior-engineer implements (parallel with review prep)
4. **Validation Phase**: framework-validation-engineer tests + framework-best-practice-auditor audits
5. **Documentation Phase**: documentation-specialist creates usage docs
6. **Integration**: Validate all quality gates, report results

**Key Innovation**: Uses Task tool to coordinate agents who build the feature. If this works, it proves the framework can build anything.

### Phase 3: Implementation (60s)

**Agents**: framework-senior-engineer + framework-code-reviewer
**Execution**: Parallel

```markdown
Task (Parallel - 2 agents):

1. Implementation:
  description: "Implement [feature_name]"
  prompt: |
    Implement feature: {feature_name}

    Design: {design_document}

    Prepare:
    - Compliance checklist (best practices to verify)
    - Test scenarios (what to test)
    - Performance criteria (targets to meet)
    - Integration points (what to check)

    Output: Complete review checklist for validation phase

```

### Phase 4: Validation (30s)

**Agents**: framework-validation-engineer + framework-best-practice-auditor
**Execution**: Sequential (needs implementation)

```markdown
Task (Sequential after implementation):

1. Testing:
  description: "Test [feature_name] implementation"
  prompt: |
    Test feature: {feature_name}

    Audit feature: {feature_name}

    Implementation: {implementation_files}
    Test results: {test_results}

    Check against:
    - claude-code-best-practices.md

```

### Phase 5: Documentation (20s)

**Agent**: documentation-specialist
**Execution**: Parallel with validation (if tests passing)

```markdown
Task:
  description: "Document [feature_name]"
  prompt: |
    Document feature: {feature_name}

    Design: {design_document}

## Why This Command Matters

**This is the proof that the framework works.**

If the Claude Agent Framework can:
1. Use its own agents (via Task tool)
2. Follow its own patterns (via context files)
3. Validate its own quality (via auditor)
5. Build new features for itself

Then it proves the framework can build **anything**.

**The Ultimate Test**: Can the framework improve itself? If yes, users can trust it to improve their projects.

---

## Example: Building task-validation Feature

**Input**: `/build-feature task-validation --description "Add validation layer for task execution"`

**What Happens**:
1. framework-feature-builder reads the request
2. Launches framework-research-specialist to research validation patterns
3. Launches framework-system-architect to design the validation system
4. Launches framework-senior-engineer + framework-code-reviewer in parallel
5. Engineer creates validate_task.py hook and updates schema
6. Launches framework-validation-engineer to test it
7. Launches framework-best-practice-auditor to check compliance
8. Launches documentation-specialist to document usage
9. Validates all quality gates
10. Reports: READY FOR MERGE

**Result**: New feature built entirely by framework's own agents, following its own best practices.

**Proof**: Framework can build itself = Framework can build anything.

## Error Handling

### If Agent Launch Fails
```markdown
❌ Phase 2 Failed: Could not launch framework-system-architect

Error: Agent not found in REGISTRY.json

Resolution:
1. Check REGISTRY.json has framework-system-architect entry
2. Verify agent file exists at path
3. Re-run /build-feature after fix
```

### If Quality Gates Fail
```markdown
⚠️ Quality Gate Failure

Gate: Compliance Score
├─ Required: >85%
├─ Actual: 72%
└─ Status: BLOCKED

Violations:
1. Missing error handling in 3 functions
2. No usage examples in documentation
3. Performance target exceeded by 30%

Action: Fix violations and re-run build
```

### If Build Times Out
```markdown
⏱️ Build Timeout

Phase: Implementation
├─ Started: 10:15:30
├─ Timeout: 10:16:30 (60s limit)
└─ Status: CANCELLED

Possible causes:
1. Feature too complex for single build
2. Agent stuck on difficult decision
3. Network issues fetching docs

Recommendations:
1. Break feature into smaller parts
2. Provide more detailed description
3. Check agent performance logs
```

---

## Tips for Success

### Feature Naming
- **Good**: `task-validation`, `context-caching`, `performance-optimizer`
- **Bad**: `feature1`, `new-thing`, `fix`

### Descriptions
- **Good**: "Add validation layer to verify task outputs match expected patterns"
- **Bad**: "Make it better"

### Scope
- **Good**: Single, well-defined feature
- **Bad**: "Rewrite entire framework"

### Complexity
- Start simple, let framework decide complexity
- Trust SIMPLICITY_ENFORCEMENT.md principles
- Let agents suggest if more complexity needed

# Look for: framework-feature-builder stats
