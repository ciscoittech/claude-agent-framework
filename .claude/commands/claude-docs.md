The research agent integrates seamlessly with existing workflows:

### **Agent Development Workflow**
```python
# 1. Research capabilities and patterns
claude_docs_researcher.research_capabilities(use_case_requirements)

# 2. Design agent architecture
architecture = claude_docs_researcher.design_architecture(requirements)

# 3. Implement with best practices
implementation = apply_best_practices(architecture)

# 4. Integrate with existing systems
integration_plan = claude_docs_researcher.create_integration_plan(tech_stack)
```

### **Team Knowledge Sharing**
```python
# Fetch latest documentation for team training
training_materials = claude_docs_researcher.create_training_materials()

# Document organizational patterns and standards
standards = claude_docs_researcher.document_standards(org_requirements)

# Create implementation guides
guides = claude_docs_researcher.create_implementation_guides()
```
