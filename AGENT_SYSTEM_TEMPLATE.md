# Claude Code Agent System - Quick Start Template
*Get your agent system running in 5 minutes*

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
# In your project root, create these directories
mkdir -p .claude/commands
mkdir -p .claude-library/agents/core
mkdir -p .claude-library/agents/specialized
mkdir -p .claude-library/contexts
```

### Step 2: Create Agent Launcher

Create `.claude/agent-launcher.md`:

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME] Agent Launcher

You are the agent launcher for [PROJECT NAME]. Your role is to analyze user requests and dynamically load appropriate agents from the `.claude-library/` directory.

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Analyze Requests**: Parse user input to determine intent
2. **Load Agents**: Dynamically load appropriate agents from library
3. **Route Tasks**: Direct requests to correct agents
4. **Manage Context**: Load relevant context files as needed

## Quick Command Reference
- `/build "description"` - Build new feature with TDD
- `/debug "issue"` - Debug problems
- `/review` - Code review
- `/test` - Run tests
- `/deploy` - Deploy to production

## Agent Categories

### Core Agents (4)
- `system-architect` - Architecture design
- `senior-engineer` - Implementation
- `code-reviewer` - Code review
- `workflow-orchestrator` - Multi-agent coordination

### Specialized Agents
[Add your domain-specific agents here]

## Loading Strategy
1. **Command Detection**: If input starts with `/`, load from `.claude/commands/`
2. **Keyword Matching**: Match keywords to agent triggers in REGISTRY.json
3. **Context Loading**: Load relevant contexts based on task

## Usage Examples

### Feature Development
User: "Build user authentication"
Action: Load senior-engineer + auth context

### Debugging
User: "Fix login error"
Action: Load debugger agent

### Architecture
User: "Design microservices architecture"
Action: Load system-architect + patterns context
```

- üîÅ Retrying
```

### Step 4: Create Your First Command

Create `.claude/commands/build.md`:

```markdown
# /build Command

## Purpose
Build features using Test-Driven Development with multiple specialized agents.

## Usage
```
/build "Feature description"
/build "API endpoint for user authentication"
```

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Architecture & Planning (Parallel)
Three agents work simultaneously:
1. **Architect**: Design system structure
2. **Test Planner**: Create test specifications
3. **Researcher**: Find existing patterns

### Stage 2: Implementation & Review (Parallel)
Two agents work together:
1. **Engineer**: Implement with TDD
2. **Reviewer**: Real-time quality checks

### Stage 3: Integration
1. **Orchestrator**: Final validation and integration

## Implementation

The command will:
1. Load agent definitions from `.claude-library/agents/`
2. Load relevant contexts from `.claude-library/contexts/`
3. Execute agents in parallel where possible
4. Synthesize results
5. Report completion

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- Code review approved
- Documentation complete
- Performance targets met
```

### Step 5: Create Registry

Create `.claude-library/REGISTRY.json`:

```json

  "project": "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
  "description": "Agent registry for YOUR_PROJECT",
  "agents": {
    "system-architect": {

  }
}
```

### Step 6: Create Project Context

Create `.claude-library/contexts/project.md`:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Overview
[Your project description]

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: [e.g., TypeScript, Python, Go]
- **Framework**: [e.g., Next.js, Django, FastAPI]
- **Database**: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
- **Testing**: [e.g., Jest, Pytest]

## Project Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/         # API routes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/  # UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/    # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/      # Data models
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/       # Test files
```

## Development Standards
- Code style: [e.g., ESLint, Black]
- Git flow: [e.g., feature branches]
- Testing: [minimum coverage]
- Documentation: [requirements]

## Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=
API_KEY=
SECRET_KEY=
```

## Common Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build production
npm run build
```
```

### Step 7: Create Settings

Create `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "project": {
    "name": "YOUR_PROJECT_NAME",
    "description": "YOUR_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION",
    "github_repo": "YOUR_GITHUB_REPO"
  }
}
```

## Customization Guide

### Adding Specialized Agents

Create `.claude-library/agents/specialized/database-expert.md`:

```markdown
# Database Expert

You are a database specialist with expertise in schema design, query optimization, and data migrations.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Design efficient database schemas
2. Optimize queries for performance
3. Create data migrations
4. Implement indexing strategies
5. Ensure data integrity

## Specialized Knowledge
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis)
- Query optimization techniques
- Index strategies
- Transaction management

[Rest of agent definition...]
```

### Adding Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/optimize.md`:

```markdown
# /optimize Command

## Purpose
Optimize code for performance

## Usage
/optimize "database queries"
/optimize "frontend bundle size"

## Workflow
1. Analyze current performance
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Implement optimizations
4. Measure improvements
```

### Adding Project-Specific Context

Create `.claude-library/contexts/api-patterns.md`:

```markdown
# API Patterns

## REST Conventions
- GET /resources - List
- GET /resources/:id - Get one
- POST /resources - Create
- PUT /resources/:id - Update
- DELETE /resources/:id - Delete

## Error Handling
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human readable message",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

## Authentication
- Bearer tokens in Authorization header
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting per API key
```

## Testing Your Setup

### Test Agent Loading
```
User: "I need to design a REST API"
Expected: System architect agent loads with API context
```

### Test Command Execution
```
User: "/build user authentication"
Expected: Parallel execution of architect, test planner, and researcher
```

### Test Context Loading
```
User: "Debug database performance"
Expected: Database expert loads with database patterns context
```

## Scaling Your System

### Progressive Enhancement
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with core agents
2. **Add Specialization**: Create domain-specific agents
3. **Optimize Workflows**: Identify parallel opportunities
4. **Refine Contexts**: Add patterns as you discover them
5. **Measure Performance**: Track execution times

### Performance Metrics
- Context size: < 10KB in .claude/
- Agent loading: < 2 seconds
- Parallel execution: 3x faster than sequential
- Cache hit rate: > 60%

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agents not loading:**
- Check REGISTRY.json syntax
- Verify file paths are correct
- Ensure triggers match user input

**Slow performance:**
- Reduce context size
- Use parallel execution
- Cache frequently used agents

**Conflicts between agents:**
- Define clear boundaries
- Use explicit triggers
- Separate concerns properly

## Next Steps

1. **Customize agents** for your domain
2. **Create specialized commands** for common tasks
3. **Build context library** with patterns
4. **Test parallel workflows** for speed
5. **Document your customizations**
