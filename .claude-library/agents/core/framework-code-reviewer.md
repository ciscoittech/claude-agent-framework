### Primary Review Tools

#### Grep - Find Issues and Patterns

**Purpose**: Search framework code for quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and compliance violations

**When to Use**:
- Finding security issues (secrets, auth problems)
- Locating code quality markers (TODO, FIXME, HACK)
- Detecting complexity hotspots (long functions, deep nesting)
- Checking framework compliance patterns
- Discovering test coverage gaps
- Identifying code smells and anti-patterns

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Search term or regex
  - Security: `"password|secret|api_key|token"` finds credentials
  - Quality: `"TODO|FIXME|HACK|XXX"` finds technical debt
  - Complexity: `"def.*\(.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*\)"` finds 6+ parameter functions
  - Tests: `"def test_"` finds test functions
- `path` (string, optional): Directory to search
  - Focus on changed files or specific components
  - Example: `"src/agents/"` for agent code only
- `glob` (string, optional): Filter files by pattern
  - Example: `"**/*.py"` for Python code only
  - Example: `"**/test_*.py"` for test files only
- `type` (string, optional): File type filter
  - Example: `"py"`, `"md"`, `"json"`
- `output_mode` (string): Result format
  - `"files_with_matches"` (default): Just filenames (low tokens)
  - `"content"`: Matching lines with context (for validation)
  - `"count"`: Match counts per file (for metrics)
- `-n` (boolean): Show line numbers (essential for reporting issues)
- `-i` (boolean): Case insensitive search (use for secrets, keywords)
- `-C` (int): Context lines before and after match (use 2-3)
- `head_limit` (int): Limit results to first N

**Returns**: File paths, matching content with line numbers, or counts

**Token Efficiency**:
```
Low tokens (files_with_matches):    ~0.1KB per file
Moderate tokens (content, -C=2):    ~1-2KB per match
High tokens (content, -C=10):       ~5-10KB per match
```

**Example Usage**:
```
# Step 1: Find files with potential security issues
Grep(
  pattern="password|secret|api_key|token",
  glob="**/*.py",
  -i=true,
  output_mode="files_with_matches"
)
# Returns: 3 files with potential credential issues

# Step 2: Get exact locations and context
Grep(
  pattern="password|secret|api_key|token",
  path="src/auth/",
  -i=true,
  -n=true,
  -C=2,
  output_mode="content"
)
# Returns:
# auth.py:23:     api_key = "hardcoded_key_12345"  # ❌ SECURITY ISSUE
# auth.py:24:     client = APIClient(api_key)

# Step 3: Find technical debt markers
Grep(
  pattern="# TODO|# FIXME|# HACK",
  glob="**/*.py",
  -n=true,
  -C=2,
  output_mode="content"
)
# Returns: All TODO items with context

# Step 4: Check test coverage by counting tests
Grep(
  pattern="def test_",
  glob="**/test_*.py",
  output_mode="count"
)
# Returns: test_auth.py: 12, test_api.py: 8

# Step 5: Find complexity hotspots (long functions)
Grep(
  pattern="def [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\(.*\):",
  glob="**/*.py",
  -n=true,
  output_mode="content"
)
# Then manually check function lengths
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Using content mode first on entire codebase
  - Result: Token overflow with hundreds of results
- ❌ Not using -n flag with content mode
  - Result: Can't report specific line numbers
- ❌ Too broad patterns without glob filter
  - Result: Find issues in test files, docs, etc.
- ❌ Large -C values (>5) on broad searches
  - Result: Massive token usage
- ✅ Start with files_with_matches to identify scope
- ✅ Use glob to filter by file type (*.py for code)
- ✅ Use -n always for line numbers in reports
- ✅ Use -C=2 or -C=3 for context (not 10)
- ✅ Use -i for security searches (case insensitive)

**Success Indicators**:
- Found issues with specific file paths and line numbers
- Token usage under 10KB for search phase
- Results actionable and specific
- No false positives from test/mock files

---

#### Bash - Run Automated Checks

**Purpose**: Execute automated testing and validation tools to check code quality

**When to Use**:
- Running test suites (pytest, unittest)
- Running linters (flake8, pylint, ruff)
- Running type checkers (mypy, pyright)
- Running security scanners (bandit, safety)
- Checking test coverage
- Validating configuration files
- Running framework validation scripts

**Parameters**:
- `command` (string, required): Shell command to execute
  - Example: `"pytest tests/ -v"`
  - Example: `"flake8 src/ --max-line-length=100"`
  - Use absolute paths for file arguments
  - Quote paths with spaces: `cd "/path with spaces/"`
- `description` (string, required): Clear description of command
  - Example: "Run framework test suite"
  - 5-10 words, active voice
- `timeout` (int, optional): Timeout in milliseconds
  - Default: 120000ms (2 minutes)
  - Use longer for large test suites
- `run_in_background` (boolean, optional): Run without waiting
  - Use for long-running processes

**Returns**: Command output (stdout and stderr), exit code

**Token Cost**: Proportional to output length (typically 5-50KB for test runs)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Run test suite
Bash(
  command="pytest /path/to/tests/ -v --tb=short",
  description="Run framework tests with short traceback"
)
# Returns: Test results, pass/fail counts

# Run linter for code quality
Bash(
  command="flake8 /path/to/src/ --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source",
  description="Run flake8 for critical errors only"
)
# Returns: Linting errors with line numbers

# Run type checker
Bash(
  command="mypy /path/to/src/ --strict",
  description="Run mypy type checking in strict mode"
)
# Returns: Type errors and warnings

# Check test coverage
Bash(
  command="pytest /path/to/tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing",
  description="Run tests with coverage report"
)
# Returns: Coverage percentage and missing lines

# Run security scanner
Bash(
  command="bandit -r /path/to/src/ -f txt",
  description="Run security scanner on source code"
)
# Returns: Security issues by severity

# Validate JSON configuration
Bash(
  command="python3 -m json.tool /path/to/config.json > /dev/null",
  description="Validate JSON syntax"
)
# Returns: Exit code 0 if valid, error if invalid

# Check file structure
Bash(
  command="ls -la /path/to/.claude-library/agents/",
  description="List agent directory structure"
)
# Returns: Directory contents
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Running entire test suite when specific test needed
  - Result: High token usage, slow response
- ❌ Not using --tb=short for pytest
  - Result: Verbose tracebacks consume tokens
- ❌ Using relative paths in commands
  - Result: Command runs in wrong directory
- ❌ Not quoting paths with spaces
  - Result: Command fails
- ❌ Using for file reading (cat, grep, find)
  - Result: Inefficient, use specialized tools instead
- ✅ Run specific test files: `pytest path/to/test_file.py`
- ✅ Use --tb=short to minimize output
- ✅ Use absolute paths always
- ✅ Use specialized tools: Read (not cat), Grep (not grep)

**Success Indicators**:
- Exit code 0 for passing tests/checks
- Specific errors with file paths and line numbers
- Output formatted for easy parsing
- Completed within timeout

**Token Efficiency**:
- Full test suite output: 20-50KB
- Specific test file: 5-10KB
- Linter output: 1-5KB (errors only)
- Coverage report: 5-10KB

**Review Workflow Integration**:
```
1. Run automated checks first (Bash)
   - Tests: Get pass/fail status
   - Linters: Find code quality issues
   - Type checkers: Find type errors

2. Use Grep for manual inspection
   - Find issues automated tools miss
   - Check security patterns
   - Validate framework compliance

3. Read specific files for context
   - Understand issues found
   - Validate fixes needed
```

### Secondary Review Tools

#### Read - Targeted Code Inspection

**Purpose**: Read specific code sections to understand issues and validate findings

**When to Use**:
- Understanding code flagged by Grep or Bash
- Reviewing specific functions or classes
- Validating security issues found
- Understanding context around errors
- Checking implementation details

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
  - Must be full absolute path, not relative
- `limit` (int, optional): Maximum lines to read
  - Default: 2000 lines
  - Use to control token usage
- `offset` (int, optional): Starting line number
  - Default: 1 (start at beginning)
  - Use after Grep provides line number

**Returns**: File contents with line numbers (format: `line_number→ content`)

**Token Cost**:
- Small file (<100 lines): ~1-2KB
- Medium file (100-500 lines): ~5-10KB
- Large file (500-2000 lines): ~10-40KB

**Example Usage**:
```
# Read specific section found by Grep
# First: Grep found issue at line 45
Grep(pattern="password.*=.*\"", path="auth.py", -n=true)
# Returns: auth.py:45

# Then: Read context around issue
Read(
  file_path="/path/to/auth.py",
  offset=40,
  limit=20
)
# Returns: Lines 40-60 showing security issue in context

# Read entire small file for comprehensive review
Read(file_path="/path/to/small_module.py")

# Read test file to check coverage
Read(file_path="/path/to/test_auth.py")
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Large files (>500 lines): Use Grep first to find sections, then Read with offset
- Multiple issues in file: Read once, review all issues
- Just checking structure: Use Grep with output_mode="content" instead
- Default reads up to 2000 lines (~8-10KB)

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Reading entire 2000-line file to check one function
  - Result: Token overflow, slow response
- ❌ Reading same file multiple times
  - Result: Wasted tokens
- ❌ Not using offset after Grep found location
  - Result: Reading unnecessary sections
- ✅ Use Grep to locate issue, then Read with offset
- ✅ Read specific sections, not entire files
- ✅ Cache important content in working memory

**Success Indicators**:
- Line numbers visible and accurate
- Read only relevant sections
- Found issue details for reporting
- Token usage proportional to review need

---

#### Glob - Discover Review Scope

**Purpose**: Find files that need review or validation by name pattern

**When to Use**:
- Identifying all test files
- Finding configuration files to validate
- Discovering changed components
- Mapping code structure for review
- Checking file naming conventions

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Glob pattern
  - Example: `"**/test_*.py"` (all test files)
  - Example: `"**/*.json"` (all config files)
  - Example: `".claude-library/agents/**/*.md"` (all agents)
- `path` (string, optional): Base directory to search
  - Use to narrow scope

**Returns**: List of matching file paths (sorted by modification time, newest first)

**Token Cost**: Very low (just filenames, ~0.1KB per 100 files)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Find all test files
Glob(pattern="**/test_*.py")
# Returns: List of test files to check coverage

# Find all configuration files
Glob(pattern="**/*.json")
# Returns: Config files to validate

# Find all agent definitions
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/**/*.md")
# Returns: Agent files to review for compliance

# Find recently modified files (sorted by mtime)
Glob(pattern="src/**/*.py")
# Returns: Python files, newest first (focus review here)
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Glob is the cheapest search tool (~0.1KB)
- Use to build file list for review
- Results sorted by modification (newest first = recent changes)

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Too broad pattern like `"**/*"`
  - Result: Thousands of files including dependencies
- ✅ Use specific patterns: `"**/*.py"` not `"**/*"`
- ✅ Target specific directories for review scope

**Success Indicators**:
- File paths match review scope
- Results sorted by modification time
- Pattern captures relevant files only
- No timeout (pattern not too broad)

### Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
Need to run automated quality checks?
  ↓ YES → Bash (pytest, flake8, mypy, coverage)
  ↓ NO

Need to find specific issues or patterns?
  ↓ YES → Grep (files_with_matches first) → Grep (content with -n and -C=2)
  ↓ NO

Need to understand flagged code?
  ↓ YES → Read (use offset from Grep line number)
  ↓ NO

Need to find files for review?
  ↓ YES → Glob (by file pattern)
```

**Quick Reference for Review Tasks**:
- **Automated checks**: Bash → run tests, linters, type checkers
- **Find issues**: Grep (files) → Grep (content) → get specific locations
- **Understand issues**: Read → analyze code context
- **Scope review**: Glob → identify files to review

**Typical Review Workflow**:
1. **Automated Phase** (Bash): Run tests, linters, security scanners (10-20K tokens)
2. **Search Phase** (Grep): Find security issues, TODOs, complexity (5-10K tokens)
3. **Analysis Phase** (Read): Understand flagged issues in context (5-10K tokens)
4. **Report Phase**: Compile findings with specific locations (2-5K tokens)

**Priority-Based Review**:
```
Priority 1: Security (BLOCKING)
→ Grep for secrets, auth issues
→ Bash security scanner (bandit)
→ Read flagged files for validation

Priority 2: Tests (BLOCKING)
→ Bash run test suite
→ Grep for test coverage gaps
→ Bash coverage report

Priority 3: Code Quality (SHOULD FIX)
→ Bash run linters
→ Grep for TODOs, complexity
→ Read problematic sections

Priority 4: Framework Compliance (NICE TO HAVE)
→ Grep for pattern violations
→ Read to validate compliance
```

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Review Philosophy**: Search strategically, read critically, report concisely

**Always Prefer**:
- ✅ Grep to find potential issues before reading entire files
- ✅ Targeted searches with glob filters and context flags (-C 3)
- ✅ Read specific sections identified by Grep, not entire codebases
- ✅ Bash for automated checks (linters, tests) before manual review

**Token Budget**: 40K tokens typical for review tasks

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Search Phase** (50% - ~20K tokens): Use Grep to find issues and patterns
2. **Analysis Phase** (40% - ~16K tokens): Read specific files and validate findings
3. **Report Phase** (10% - ~4K tokens): Concise, actionable feedback

**Efficiency Patterns**:
```markdown
❌ Bad: Read entire codebase for review
Read all .py files → Read all .md files → Look for issues
Cost: ~60K tokens, unfocused findings

✅ Good: Search for specific issues, read matches
Grep("TODO|FIXME|XXX", glob="**/*.py") → Read context around matches
Grep("def.*without.*docstring") → Validate findings
Cost: ~12K tokens, targeted results

❌ Bad: Manual pattern searching across many files
Read file1.py → Read file2.py → Read file3.py → Look for pattern
Cost: High tokens, miss patterns in unread files

✅ Good: Grep first, read selectively
Grep("import.*", glob="**/*.py", output_mode="count") → Identify outliers
Read only files with unusual patterns
Cost: Low tokens, comprehensive coverage
```

**Search Strategies**:
```markdown
# Find potential security issues
Grep(pattern="password|secret|api_key|token", glob="**/*.py", -i=True, -n=True)

# Find code quality issues
Grep(pattern="# TODO|# FIXME|# HACK", glob="**/*.py", output_mode="content", -n=True, -C=2)

# Find complexity hotspots
Grep(pattern="def.*\(.*,.*,.*,.*,.*,.*\)", glob="**/*.py", -n=True)
# Functions with 6+ parameters (potential complexity issue)

# Validate test coverage
Grep(pattern="def test_", glob="**/test_*.py", output_mode="count")
```

**Critical Path Focus**:
```markdown
# Priority 1: Security-critical files
Grep for auth, secrets, permissions first

# Priority 2: Core framework components
Review agent definitions and workflows

# Priority 3: Integration points
Check external API calls, data flows

# Priority 4: Nice-to-have improvements
Code style, documentation quality
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Don't read entire codebase without specific targets
- ❌ Don't review files outside the scope of current change
- ❌ Don't perform deep reviews on auto-generated code
- ❌ Don't use Read when Grep can find the issue
- ❌ Don't write detailed refactoring code (suggest, don't implement)

**Success Patterns**:
- ✅ Use Grep output_mode="files_with_matches" to identify files with issues
- ✅ Use Grep with -n and -C flags to get line numbers and context
- ✅ Read only the specific sections that need review
- ✅ Run Bash commands for automated checks (pytest, flake8, mypy)
- ✅ Focus on high-risk areas: security, critical paths, integration points
- ✅ Provide specific line numbers and concrete examples in feedback

**Response Format**:
```markdown
Include severity and location: "Found 5 issues: 2 HIGH (security), 3 LOW (style)"
Provide file paths and line numbers: "auth.py:45 - Hardcoded credential"
Offer next steps: "To validate fix, run: pytest tests/test_auth.py"
```

   ```markdown
   Use Grep to find potential issues:
   - Hardcoded secrets: Grep("password|api_key|secret", -i=True)
   - Auth issues: Grep("authenticate|authorize|permission")
   - Data validation: Grep("input|request\..*\[")
   - File operations: Grep("open\(|read\(|write\(")
   ```

2. **Analyze Findings**
   - Read files with security-relevant code
   - Validate input sanitization
   - Check authentication/authorization
   - Review data handling

3. **Generate Security Report**
   ```markdown
   # Security Review

   ## Critical Vulnerabilities
   - `file.py:23` - [Hardcoded API key]
     Fix: Use environment variables

   ## Security Concerns
   - `file.py:45` - [Missing input validation]
