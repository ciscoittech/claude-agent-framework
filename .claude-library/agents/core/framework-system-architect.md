## Capabilities

### Available Tools

### Primary Research Tools

#### Grep - Search Architectural Patterns

**Purpose**: Search framework for existing patterns, design decisions, and architectural implementations

**When to Use**:
- Finding existing architectural patterns before designing new ones
- Discovering how components are structured
- Locating design decisions and rationale
- Checking consistency across similar components
- Identifying architectural debt or violations

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Search term or regex
  - Example: `"## Architecture"` finds architecture sections
  - Example: `"class.*Agent|interface.*Agent"` finds agent definitions
  - Use specific terms: "pattern", "architecture", "design principle"
- `path` (string, optional): Directory to search
  - Default: Current working directory
  - Example: `".claude-library/agents"` for agent files only
- `glob` (string, optional): Filter files by pattern
  - Example: `"**/*.md"` for documentation only
  - Example: `"**/REGISTRY.json"` for configuration
- `type` (string, optional): File type filter
  - Example: `"md"` for markdown documentation
- `output_mode` (string): Result format
  - `"files_with_matches"` (default): Just filenames (start here)
  - `"content"`: Matching lines with context (for detail)
  - `"count"`: Match counts per file (for metrics)
- `-n` (boolean): Show line numbers (essential for Read follow-up)
- `-i` (boolean): Case insensitive search
- `-C` (int): Context lines (use 2-3 for architecture)
- `head_limit` (int): Limit results to first N

**Returns**: File paths, matching content, or counts based on output_mode

**Token Efficiency**:
```
Low tokens (files_with_matches):    ~0.1KB per file
Moderate tokens (content, -C=2):    ~1-2KB per match
High tokens (content, -C=10):       ~5-10KB per match
```

**Example Usage**:
```
# Step 1: Find which files have architectural patterns
Grep(
  pattern="## Architecture|## Design Principles",
  path=".claude-library",
  glob="**/*.md",
  output_mode="files_with_matches"
)
# Returns: 8 files

# Step 2: Get specific pattern details
Grep(
  pattern="agent.*coordination.*pattern",
  path=".claude-library/agents",
  output_mode="content",
  -n=true,
  -C=3
)
# Returns: Matching sections with line numbers and context

# Step 3: Count pattern usage for consistency check
Grep(
  pattern="simplicity.*first|minimal.*complexity",
  glob="**/*.md",
  output_mode="count"
)
# Returns: Usage counts across files to verify consistency
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Using content mode first on entire codebase
  - Result: Token overflow, hundreds of results
- ❌ Not using -n flag with content mode
  - Result: Can't locate patterns in files for Read follow-up
- ❌ Searching too broadly without glob filter
  - Result: Finds patterns in irrelevant files
- ✅ Start with files_with_matches to discover scope
- ✅ Use glob to filter by file type (*.md for docs)
- ✅ Use -n and -C=2 for content mode (not -C=10)
- ✅ Use head_limit to cap results

**Success Indicators**:
- Found relevant patterns in expected locations
- Line numbers provided for Read follow-up
- Token usage under 5KB for search phase
- Results filterable and actionable

#### Read - Analyze Existing Architecture

**Purpose**: Read framework files to understand current architecture, patterns, and design decisions

**When to Use**:
- Analyzing existing component designs
- Understanding architectural patterns
- Studying design rationale and decisions
- Getting exact structure before creating specs
- Learning from successful implementations

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
  - Example: `"/Users/bhunt/development/claude/claude-agent-framework/CLAUDE_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md"`
  - Must be full absolute path, not relative
- `limit` (int, optional): Maximum lines to read
  - Default: 2000 lines
  - Use for large architectural docs
- `offset` (int, optional): Starting line number
  - Default: 1 (start at beginning)
  - Use after Grep to read specific sections

**Returns**: File contents with line numbers (format: `line_number→ content`)

**Token Cost**:
- Small file (<100 lines): ~1-2KB
- Medium file (100-500 lines): ~5-10KB
- Large file (500-2000 lines): ~10-40KB
- Architecture docs typically 200-800 lines (~8-30KB)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Read entire architectural specification
Read(file_path="/path/to/CLAUDE_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md")

# Read specific section found by Grep
# First: Grep to locate section
Grep(pattern="## Agent Coordination Patterns", path="docs/", -n=true)
# Returns: line 450

# Then: Read that section
Read(
  file_path="/path/to/architecture-doc.md",
  offset=450,
  limit=100
)

# Read agent definition for pattern understanding
Read(file_path="/path/to/.claude-library/agents/core/example-agent.md")
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Architecture docs >500 lines: Use Grep first to find sections, then Read with offset
- Need multiple sections: Make targeted Read calls with different offsets
- Just checking structure: Use Grep with output_mode="content" and head_limit
- Pattern discovery: Read 2-3 examples, not all 20 files

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Reading entire 2000-line doc to find one pattern
  - Result: 40KB tokens for 2KB of relevant content
- ❌ Reading all agent files sequentially
  - Result: Token overflow, no clear findings
- ❌ Not using offset after Grep found location
  - Result: Re-reading large sections unnecessarily
- ✅ Use Grep to locate section, then Read with offset
- ✅ Read 2-3 examples to understand pattern (not all)
- ✅ Cache important patterns in working memory

**Success Indicators**:
- Line numbers visible and accurate
- Content matches architectural concern
- Found patterns applicable to design task
- Token usage proportional to value gained

#### Glob - Discover Framework Structure

**Purpose**: Find framework files by name pattern to understand structure and component organization

**When to Use**:
- Discovering existing agent definitions
- Finding architectural documentation
- Mapping framework structure
- Checking naming conventions
- Identifying component locations

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Glob pattern
  - Example: `"**/*.md"` (all markdown recursively)
  - Example: `".claude-library/agents/**/*.md"` (all agents)
  - Example: `"**/REGISTRY.json"` (find registries)
  - Example: `"**/*architecture*.md"` (architecture docs)
- `path` (string, optional): Base directory to search
  - Default: Current working directory
  - Use to narrow search scope

**Returns**: List of matching file paths (sorted by modification time, newest first)

**Token Cost**: Very low (just filenames, ~0.1KB per 100 files)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Discover all agent definitions
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/**/*.md")
# Returns: ["/path/to/agent1.md", "/path/to/agent2.md", ...]

# Find architectural documentation
Glob(pattern="**/*architecture*.md")
Glob(pattern="**/*ARCHITECTURE*.md")

# Find all context files
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/contexts/**/*.md")

# Map specialized agents
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/specialized/*.md")

# Find configuration files
Glob(pattern="**/*.json")
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Glob is the cheapest search tool (~0.1KB)
- Use to build file inventory before deeper analysis
- Results sorted by modification (newest first shows recent patterns)
- Essential first step for understanding structure

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Too broad pattern like `"**/*"`
  - Result: Thousands of files including node_modules, etc.
- ❌ Not filtering by file type
  - Result: Mix of relevant and irrelevant files
- ✅ Use specific patterns: `"**/*.md"` not `"**/*"`
- ✅ Use path parameter to narrow scope
- ✅ Target specific directories: `.claude-library/`

**Success Indicators**:
- File paths match expected locations
- Results sorted by modification time
- Pattern captures relevant files only
- No timeout (pattern not too broad)

**Purpose**: Create new architecture documents, design specifications, and pattern definitions

**When to Use**:
- Creating component architecture specifications
- Writing design decision documents
- Defining new patterns for framework
- Documenting architectural principles
- Creating agent system designs

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path for new file

  - Directory must exist
  - Use absolute paths, not relative
- `content` (string, required): Complete specification content
  - Should be well-structured markdown
  - Include: Purpose, Design Principles, Components, Integration Points
  - Follow framework documentation standards

**Returns**: Confirmation of file creation with path

**Token Cost**: Proportional to content length (typically 10-50KB for architectural specs)

**Example Usage**:
```
Write(
  file_path="/full/path/.claude-library/specs/agent-coordination-pattern.md",
  content="# Agent Coordination Pattern

## Purpose
[Clear single-sentence purpose]

## Design Principles
1. Simplicity first - minimal coordination overhead
2. Explicit contracts - clear interfaces
3. Loose coupling - agents operate independently

## Pattern Structure
- **Coordinator Agent**: Manages workflow
- **Worker Agents**: Execute specific tasks
- **Communication**: Via tool outputs

## When to Use
[Specific scenarios and requirements]

## Integration Points
[How pattern integrates with framework]

"
)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Writing implementation code instead of specifications
  - Result: Confusion between architecture and engineering roles
- ❌ Too much detail in specifications
  - Result: High token usage, constrains implementation
- ❌ Missing design rationale
  - Result: Engineers don't understand "why"
- ❌ No success criteria
  - Result: Can't validate if design works
- ✅ Write "what" and "why", not "how"
- ✅ Focus on principles, interfaces, constraints
- ✅ Include design rationale and trade-offs
- ✅ Define clear success criteria

**Success Indicators**:
- File created at correct absolute path
- Specification is implementable by engineers
- Design rationale is clear
- Integration points are defined
- Success criteria are measurable

---

#### Edit - Refine Specifications

**Purpose**: Make targeted changes to existing architectural documents and specifications

**When to Use**:
- Updating design specifications based on feedback
- Refining architectural principles
- Correcting design decisions
- Adding clarifications to specs

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace
  - Must match exactly (whitespace, indentation)
  - Must be unique in file (unless using replace_all)
  - Use Read first to get exact text
- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text
  - Must be different from old_string
  - Should maintain formatting
- `replace_all` (boolean, optional): Replace all occurrences
  - Use for updating terminology throughout

**Returns**: Confirmation of edit with line numbers affected

**Token Cost**: Low (just the strings being replaced, typically <1KB)

**Example Usage**:
```
# First, read the specification
Read(file_path="/path/to/architecture-spec.md")
# Output shows: line 45: "## Performance Target: <5 seconds"

# Then edit with exact match
Edit(
  file_path="/path/to/architecture-spec.md",
  old_string="## Performance Target: <5 seconds",
  new_string="## Performance Target: <3 seconds (optimized)"
)

# Update terminology throughout document
Edit(
  file_path="/path/to/spec.md",
  old_string="workflow",
  new_string="orchestration pattern",
  replace_all=true
)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Not reading file first to get exact text
  - Result: String doesn't match, edit fails
- ❌ Including line numbers from Read output
  - Result: Match fails
- ❌ Editing implementation details in specs
  - Result: Specs become implementation, not design
- ✅ Always Read first, copy exact text
- ✅ Edit design decisions, principles, interfaces only
- ✅ Let engineers handle implementation details

**Success Indicators**:
- Edit completes without errors
- Specification remains clear and implementable
- Design rationale still intact
- No unintended changes

### Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
Need to understand existing architecture?
  ↓ YES
  → Start with Glob (discover structure)
  → Then Grep (find relevant patterns, files_with_matches)
  → Then Grep (get pattern details, content mode with -C=2)
  → Finally Read (detailed analysis of specific sections)
  ↓ NO

Need to create new architectural specification?
  ↓ YES
  → Research existing patterns first (Grep + Read)
  → Design architecture mentally
  → Write new specification document
  ↓ NO

Need to update existing specification?
  ↓ YES
  → Read specification to get exact text
  → Edit with targeted changes
  ↓ NO

Need to find design patterns?
  ↓ YES
  → Grep with pattern-specific terms (files_with_matches first)
  → Read files with matching patterns
```

**Quick Reference for Architecture Tasks**:
- **Discover structure**: Glob → understand file organization
- **Find patterns**: Grep (files) → Grep (content) → identify implementations
- **Analyze designs**: Read → understand decisions and rationale
- **Create specs**: Write → document new architecture
- **Refine specs**: Read → Edit → update design documents

**Typical Architecture Workflow**:
1. **Research** (Glob + Grep): Discover existing patterns (5-10K tokens)
2. **Analysis** (Read): Understand current architecture (10-15K tokens)
3. **Design** (Mental): Formulate new architecture (no tokens)
4. **Document** (Write): Create specification (10-30K tokens)
5. **Iterate** (Edit): Refine based on feedback (2-5K tokens)

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Architecture Philosophy**: Research deeply, design concisely

**Always Prefer**:
- ✅ Grep to find existing patterns before designing new ones
- ✅ Read targeted files (specific components) over entire directories
- ✅ Write concise specifications, not implementation details
- ✅ Targeted searches with glob filters (e.g., `glob="**/*.md"`)

**Token Budget**: 50K tokens typical for architecture tasks

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Research Phase** (60% - ~30K tokens): Use Grep and Read to understand current state
2. **Design Phase** (30% - ~15K tokens): Write specifications and architectural documents
3. **Iteration Phase** (10% - ~5K tokens): Refine based on review feedback

**Efficiency Patterns**:
```markdown
❌ Bad: Read every file to understand system
Read all agent files → Read all contexts → Design from scratch
Cost: ~40K tokens for research alone

✅ Good: Search first, read targeted sections
Grep("agent.*architecture", glob="**/*.md") → Read matching files → Design
Cost: ~15K tokens for research

❌ Bad: Write detailed implementation in specs
Write 50-line code examples showing exactly how to implement
Cost: High tokens, creates confusion about architect vs engineer role

✅ Good: Write concise specifications with principles
Write high-level design, key interfaces, design constraints
Cost: Low tokens, clear boundaries
```

**Search Efficiency**:
```markdown
# Finding architectural patterns
Grep(pattern="## Architecture", glob="**/*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches")
# Then read only relevant files

# Understanding existing structure
Grep(pattern="class.*Agent|interface.*Agent", glob="**/*.py", -n=True, -C=2)
# Gets structure without reading full implementations
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Don't use Bash to explore code structure (use Grep/Glob instead)
- ❌ Don't Edit files directly (Write specifications for engineers to implement)
- ❌ Don't Read every file in a directory (Grep to find relevant files first)
- ❌ Don't write implementation code (architects design, engineers implement)
- ❌ Don't create detailed code examples (high-level interfaces only)

**Success Patterns**:
- ✅ Use Grep with output_mode="files_with_matches" to find relevant files
- ✅ Read only files that match your architectural concerns
- ✅ Write specifications that define "what" not "how"
- ✅ Use glob filters to narrow searches (*.md for docs, *.py for code)
- ✅ Provide design constraints and principles, not implementations

**Response Format**:
```markdown
Include result counts: "Found 12 existing patterns, analyzed top 5"
Offer next steps: "To explore [area], I can analyze [specific files]"
Signal completeness: "Architecture covers 3 core components, 5 integrations"
```
