## Available Tools

### Primary Implementation Tools

#### Write - Create New Files

**Purpose**: Create new framework files from scratch

**When to Use**:
- Creating new agent definitions
- Building new workflow commands
- Writing new context documents
- Adding new configuration files

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path for new file
  - Example: `"/Users/bhunt/development/claude/claude-agent-framework/.claude-library/agents/core/new-agent.md"`
  - Directory must exist or will be created
  - Use absolute paths, not relative
- `content` (string, required): Complete file content
  - Should be well-formatted markdown for agent/context files
  - Include metadata at top for traceability
  - Follow framework templates

**Returns**: Confirmation of file creation with path

**Token Cost**: Proportional to content length (typically 5-50KB per file)

**Example Usage**:
```
Write(
  file_path="/full/path/.claude-library/agents/specialized/performance-optimizer.md",
  content="# Performance Optimizer Agent\n\nYou are a performance optimization specialist...\n\n## Available Tools\n\n..."
)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Using relative path: `".claude-library/agents/new.md"`
  - Result: File created in wrong location
- ❌ Writing without checking if file exists
  - Result: Overwrites existing file
- ❌ Missing metadata (author, date, version)
  - Result: Hard to track changes
- ✅ Use absolute path, check existence first with Glob
- ✅ Include metadata and follow framework templates
- ✅ Preview content structure before writing

**Success Indicators**:
- File created at correct absolute path
- Content follows framework conventions
- Metadata present and accurate
- No overwrites of existing files

---

#### Edit - Modify Existing Files

**Purpose**: Make targeted changes to existing framework files using exact string replacement

**When to Use**:
- Updating agent tool lists
- Modifying configuration values
- Fixing bugs in existing code
- Adding new sections to documentation

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
  - Example: `"/Users/bhunt/development/claude/claude-agent-framework/.claude-library/REGISTRY.json"`
  - Must be exact absolute path
- `old_string` (string, required): Exact text to replace
  - Must match exactly (whitespace, indentation, everything)
  - Must be unique in file (unless using replace_all)
  - Use Read first to get exact text
- `new_string` (string, required): Replacement text
  - Must be different from old_string
  - Should maintain formatting and indentation
- `replace_all` (boolean, optional): Replace all occurrences
  - Default: false (single replacement)
  - Use true for renaming variables/terms throughout file

**Returns**: Confirmation of edit with line numbers affected

**Token Cost**: Low (just the strings being replaced, typically <1KB)

**Example Usage**:
```
# First, read the file to get exact text
Read(file_path="/path/to/agent.md")
# Output shows: line 15: "tools": ["Read", "Write"]

# Then edit with exact match
Edit(
  file_path="/path/to/agent.md",
  old_string='  "tools": ["Read", "Write"]',
  new_string='  "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Grep"]'
)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Not reading file first to get exact text
  - Result: String doesn't match, edit fails
- ❌ Wrong indentation in old_string
  - Result: Match fails silently
- ❌ Including line numbers from Read output
  - Result: Match fails (line numbers are added by Read tool)
- ❌ Non-unique old_string without replace_all
  - Result: Edit fails with ambiguity error
- ✅ Always Read first, copy exact text
- ✅ Preserve indentation exactly
- ✅ Use replace_all for renaming throughout file

**Success Indicators**:
- Edit completes without errors
- Line numbers returned match expected location
- File content verified with Read after edit
- No unintended changes to other parts of file

---

#### MultiEdit - Multiple Changes to One File

**Purpose**: Make multiple targeted edits to a single file in one operation

**When to Use**:
- Updating multiple related sections in one file
- Refactoring with several small changes
- Renaming multiple occurrences with different contexts
- Batch updates to configuration

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
- `edits` (array, required): List of edit objects
  - Each edit has: `old_string`, `new_string`, `replace_all` (optional)
  - Edits applied in order specified
  - Each old_string must be unique after previous edits

**Returns**: Confirmation of all edits with line numbers

**Token Cost**: Moderate (proportional to number of edits, typically 2-10KB)

**Example Usage**:
```
MultiEdit(
  file_path="/path/to/REGISTRY.json",
  edits=[
    {
      old_string: '"priority": 1',
      new_string: '"priority": 2'
    },
    {
      old_string: '"tools": ["Read"]',
      new_string: '"tools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit"]'
    },
    {
      old_string: '"version": "1.0.0"',
      new_string: '"version": "1.1.0"'
    }
  ]
)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Edits that overlap or conflict
  - Result: Later edits may fail
- ❌ Wrong order of edits
  - Result: Context changes, matches fail
- ❌ Not reading file first
  - Result: Can't verify exact strings
- ✅ Read file first to verify all strings
- ✅ Order edits logically (top to bottom usually)
- ✅ Test each edit would work individually

**Success Indicators**:
- All edits complete successfully
- Line numbers make sense
- No conflicts between edits
- File structure maintained

**Token Efficiency**:
- Use MultiEdit instead of multiple Edit calls (saves overhead)
- Group related changes in single MultiEdit
- Read once, edit many times

---

### Code Analysis and Search Tools

#### Read - Examine Existing Code

**Purpose**: Read framework files to understand current implementation

**When to Use**:
- Understanding existing agent structure before modifying
- Reviewing framework patterns to follow
- Getting exact text before Edit operations
- Studying context documents for integration

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
  - Example: `"/Users/bhunt/development/claude/claude-agent-framework/CLAUDE_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md"`
  - Must be full absolute path
- `limit` (int, optional): Maximum lines to read
  - Default: 2000 lines
  - Use for large files to control tokens
- `offset` (int, optional): Starting line number
  - Default: 1 (start at beginning)
  - Use with limit for pagination

**Returns**: File contents with line numbers (format: `line_number→ content`)

**Token Cost**:
- Small file (<100 lines): ~1-2KB
- Medium file (100-500 lines): ~5-10KB
- Large file (500-2000 lines): ~10-40KB
- Use limit to control cost

**Example Usage**:
```
# Read entire small file
Read(file_path="/path/to/agent.md")

# Read specific section of large file
# First, use Grep to find section
Grep(pattern="## Available Tools", path="agent.md", -n=true)
# Returns: line 50

# Then read that section
Read(
  file_path="/path/to/agent.md",
  offset=50,
  limit=100
)
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Large files (>500 lines): Use Grep first to find sections, then Read with offset
- Need multiple sections: Make multiple Read calls with different offsets
- Just checking structure: Use Grep with output_mode="content" and head_limit
- Default reads up to 2000 lines (~8-10KB)

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Reading 3000-line file completely
  - Result: Token overflow, slow response
- ❌ Using relative path
  - Result: File not found
- ❌ Reading same file multiple times
  - Result: Wasted tokens
- ✅ Use Grep to locate sections first
- ✅ Read specific sections with offset/limit
- ✅ Cache important content in your working memory

**Success Indicators**:
- Line numbers visible and accurate
- Content matches expected file
- Full absolute path confirmed
- No truncation warnings (unless expected)

---

#### Grep - Search File Contents

**Purpose**: Search framework files for patterns, implementations, or specific text

**When to Use**:
- Finding where a concept is implemented
- Locating configuration values
- Checking if a pattern already exists
- Finding files that need updating

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Search term or regex
  - Example: `"agent.*definition"` matches "agent definition", "agent_definition", etc.
  - Use `.*` for flexible matching
  - Literal braces need escaping: `"interface\\{\\}"` to find `interface{}`
- `path` (string, optional): Directory or file to search
  - Default: Current working directory
  - Example: `".claude-library/agents"`
  - Use specific paths to narrow results
- `glob` (string, optional): Filter files by pattern
  - Example: `"*.md"` for markdown only
  - Example: `"**/*.json"` for all JSON recursively
- `type` (string, optional): File type filter
  - Example: `"py"`, `"md"`, `"json"`
  - More efficient than glob for standard types
- `output_mode` (string): Result format
  - `"files_with_matches"` (default): Just filenames (low tokens)
  - `"content"`: Matching lines with context (moderate tokens)
  - `"count"`: Match counts per file (low tokens)
- `-n` (boolean): Show line numbers (recommended)
  - Only works with output_mode="content"
- `-i` (boolean): Case insensitive search
- `-C` (int): Context lines before and after match
  - Only works with output_mode="content"
  - Example: `-C=3` shows 3 lines before and after
- `head_limit` (int): Limit output lines/entries
  - Works across all output modes

**Returns**:
- files_with_matches: List of file paths
- content: Matching lines with optional context and line numbers
- count: Number of matches per file

**Token Efficiency**:
```
Low tokens (files_with_matches):    ~0.1KB per file
Moderate tokens (content, -C=2):    ~1-2KB per match
High tokens (content, -C=10):       ~5-10KB per match
```

**Example Usage**:
```
# Step 1: Find which files contain pattern (low tokens)
Grep(
  pattern="performance.*optimization",
  path=".claude-library",
  glob="**/*.md",
  output_mode="files_with_matches"
)
# Returns: List of 5 files

# Step 2: Get content from specific file (moderate tokens)
Grep(
  pattern="performance.*optimization",
  path=".claude-library/contexts/performance-optimization.md",
  output_mode="content",
  -n=true,
  -C=3
)
# Returns: Matching lines with context and line numbers

# Step 3: Read full context around match
Read(file_path="/path/to/file.md", offset=150, limit=50)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Using content mode first on entire codebase
  - Result: Token overflow with hundreds of results
- ❌ Not using -n flag with content mode
  - Result: Can't locate matches in file
- ❌ Large -C values (>5) on broad searches
  - Result: Massive token usage
- ❌ Forgetting to escape special regex characters
  - Result: Unexpected matches or errors
- ✅ Start with files_with_matches, then content for specific files
- ✅ Use glob/type to filter file types
- ✅ Use head_limit to cap results
- ✅ Use -C=2 or -C=3 for context (not 10)

**Success Indicators**:
- Results match expected pattern
- Line numbers present when requested
- No token overflow
- File paths are correct and accessible

---

#### Glob - Find Files by Name Pattern

**Purpose**: Discover which framework files exist matching a pattern

**When to Use**:
- Finding all agent definition files
- Locating configuration files
- Discovering documentation structure
- Checking if files exist before Write

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Glob pattern
  - Example: `"**/*.md"` (all markdown recursively)
  - Example: `".claude-library/agents/core/*.md"` (core agents only)
  - Example: `"**/REGISTRY.json"` (find REGISTRY files)
- `path` (string, optional): Base directory to search
  - Default: Current working directory
  - Use to narrow search scope

**Returns**: List of matching file paths (sorted by modification time, newest first)

**Token Cost**: Very low (just filenames, ~0.1KB per 100 files)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Find all agent definition files
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/**/*.md")
# Returns: ["/path/to/agent1.md", "/path/to/agent2.md", ...]

# Find all context files
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/contexts/**/*.md")

# Check if file exists before writing
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/core/new-agent.md")
# Returns: [] if doesn't exist, ["/path/to/file"] if exists

# Find all JSON config files
Glob(pattern="**/*.json")
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Glob is the cheapest search tool (~0.1KB)
- Use before Write to check existence
- Use to build file lists for batch operations
- Results sorted by modification (newest first helps find recent work)

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Using with Read in a loop (inefficient)
  - Result: Many tool calls, slow
- ❌ Too broad pattern like `"**/*"`
  - Result: Thousands of files returned
- ✅ Use specific patterns: `"**/*.md"` not `"**/*"`
- ✅ Use Glob for listing, Grep for searching content
- ✅ Combine with specific path to narrow results

**Success Indicators**:
- File paths match expected pattern
- Results sorted by modification time
- Pattern syntax accepted without errors
- No timeout (pattern not too broad)

---

### Execution and Testing Tools

#### Bash - Execute Commands

**Purpose**: Run shell commands for testing, validation, and framework operations

**When to Use**:
- Testing implemented features
- Running framework validation scripts
- Checking file permissions and structure
- Executing git operations
- Installing dependencies
- Running pytest or other test suites

**Parameters**:
- `command` (string, required): Shell command to execute
  - Example: `"pytest tests/test_framework.py -v"`
  - Use absolute paths for file arguments
  - Quote paths with spaces: `cd "/path with spaces/"`
  - Chain with && for sequential: `cd /path && pytest`
- `description` (string, required): Clear description of what command does
  - Example: "Run framework validation tests"
  - 5-10 words, active voice
  - Helps track command purpose
- `timeout` (int, optional): Timeout in milliseconds
  - Default: 120000ms (2 minutes)
  - Max: 600000ms (10 minutes)
  - Use longer timeout for test suites
- `run_in_background` (boolean, optional): Run without waiting
  - Default: false
  - Use for long-running processes
  - Monitor with BashOutput tool

**Returns**: Command output (stdout and stderr), exit code

**Token Cost**: Proportional to output length (typically 1-50KB)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Run tests
Bash(
  command="pytest /Users/bhunt/development/claude/claude-agent-framework/tests/ -v",
  description="Run framework test suite"
)

# Check file structure
Bash(
  command="ls -la /Users/bhunt/development/claude/claude-agent-framework/.claude-library/agents/",
  description="List agent directory structure"
)

# Chain commands
Bash(
  command="cd /path/to/project && python3 -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short",
  description="Run tests with short traceback"
)

# Long-running background process
Bash(
  command="npm run build",
  description="Build project",
  run_in_background=true,
  timeout=300000
)
```

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Using relative paths in commands
  - Result: Command runs in wrong directory
- ❌ Not quoting paths with spaces
  - Result: Command fails with "file not found"
- ❌ Using cd without && for subsequent commands
  - Result: Directory change doesn't persist
- ❌ Missing description parameter
  - Result: Tool call fails
- ❌ Using for file operations (cat, grep, find)
  - Result: Inefficient, use specialized tools instead
- ✅ Use absolute paths always
- ✅ Quote paths with spaces: `"cd \"/path with spaces/\""`
- ✅ Chain with &&: `"cd /path && command"`
- ✅ Use specialized tools: Read (not cat), Grep (not grep), Glob (not find)
- ✅ Provide clear description

**Success Indicators**:
- Exit code 0 (success)
- Expected output format
- No error messages in stderr
- Command completed within timeout

**Token Efficiency**:
- Command output can be large (10-50KB for test suites)
- Use specific test files instead of entire suite when possible
- Use `--tb=short` for pytest to reduce traceback verbosity
- Use `2>&1 | head -100` to limit output if just checking

**Use Cases by Category**:

**Testing**:
```bash
pytest /path/to/tests/ -v
pytest /path/to/specific_test.py::test_function -v
python3 -m pytest tests/ --tb=short
```

**Validation**:
```bash
ls -la /path/to/check/structure/
find /path -name "*.md" | wc -l
du -sh /path/to/directory/
```

**Git Operations**:
```bash
git status
git diff path/to/file
git log --oneline -5
```

**File Operations** (only when specialized tools can't do it):
```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/new/directory
cp -r /source/path /destination/path
chmod +x /path/to/script.sh
```

## Tool Selection Decision Tree

```
Need to create new file?
  ↓ YES → Check existence first (Glob) → Write
  ↓ NO

Need to modify existing file?
  ↓ YES → Read first → Edit or MultiEdit
  ↓ NO

Need to find files?
  ↓ YES → Glob (by name pattern)
  ↓ NO

Need to search file contents?
  ↓ YES → Grep (files_with_matches first) → Grep (content) or Read (sections)
  ↓ NO

Need to execute/test?
  ↓ YES → Bash
  ↓ NO

Need to understand existing code?
  ↓ YES → Grep (find relevant files) → Read (specific sections)
```

**Quick Reference**:
- **Create**: Glob (check) → Write
- **Modify**: Read → Edit/MultiEdit
- **Find files**: Glob
- **Search content**: Grep
- **Understand**: Grep → Read
- **Test/Execute**: Bash

---

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Typical Implementation Task Budget**: 50-80K tokens

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Analysis** (20%): Grep/Read to understand current state (10-15K tokens)
2. **Planning** (10%): Design changes mentally (5-10K tokens)
3. **Implementation** (40%): Write/Edit files (20-35K tokens)
4. **Validation** (20%): Bash tests, Read results (10-15K tokens)
5. **Documentation** (10%): Update docs (5-10K tokens)

**Efficiency by Tool**:

| Tool | Token Cost | When to Use | When to Avoid |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Glob | Very Low (~0.1KB) | Finding files by name | Searching content |
| Grep (files) | Low (~0.5KB) | Finding which files have content | Getting actual content |
| Grep (content) | Medium (~2KB/match) | Finding specific implementations | Broad searches |
| Read (section) | Medium (~5KB/100 lines) | Understanding specific code | Exploring entire file |
| Read (full) | High (~10-40KB) | Small files only | Large files (>500 lines) |
| Edit | Low (~1KB) | Single change | Multiple changes |
| MultiEdit | Medium (~5KB) | Multiple changes to one file | Changes across files |
| Write | Medium (~10-50KB) | Creating new files | Modifying existing (use Edit) |
| Bash | Variable (~5-50KB) | Testing, validation | File reading/searching |

**Do's**:
- ✅ Use Glob to check file existence before Write (saves overwrites)
- ✅ Use Grep files_with_matches → content → Read (progressive detail)
- ✅ Use Read with offset/limit for large files (controlled tokens)
- ✅ Use MultiEdit instead of multiple Edit calls (reduces overhead)
- ✅ Use Bash with specific commands (not entire test suites)
- ✅ Cache important content in working memory (avoid re-reading)

**Don'ts**:
- ❌ Read entire 2000-line file to find one function
- ❌ Use Grep content mode on entire codebase
- ❌ Multiple Edit calls to same file (use MultiEdit)
- ❌ Write file without checking existence first
- ❌ Bash for file operations (use specialized tools)
- ❌ Re-read same file multiple times

## Implementation Workflow Pattern

### Step 1: Analysis (5-10 minutes)

```markdown
1. Use Grep to find relevant existing implementations
2. Use Read to understand current patterns
3. Identify files that need creation/modification
4. Plan changes following framework patterns
```

**Example**:
```
# Find similar agents to understand pattern
Grep(
  pattern="agent.*definition",
  path=".claude-library/agents",
  output_mode="files_with_matches"
)

# Read one to understand structure
Read(file_path="/path/to/similar-agent.md", limit=200)

# Check framework patterns
Read(file_path="/path/to/CLAUDE_AGENT_FRAMEWORK.md", offset=500, limit=100)
```

---

### Step 2: Implementation (15-30 minutes)

```markdown
1. Create new files with Write (check existence with Glob first)
2. Modify existing files with Edit/MultiEdit (Read first for exact text)
3. Follow framework templates and patterns
4. Maintain consistency with existing code
```

**Example**:
```
# Check if file already exists
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/core/new-agent.md")

# Create new agent
Write(
  file_path="/full/path/.claude-library/agents/core/new-agent.md",
  content="[Complete agent definition]"
)

# Update registry
Read(file_path="/path/to/REGISTRY.json")
Edit(
  file_path="/path/to/REGISTRY.json",
  old_string='  }
}',
  new_string='  },
  "new-agent": {
    "path": ".claude-library/agents/core/new-agent.md",
    "type": "core",
    "tools": ["Read", "Write"]
  }
}'
)
```

---

### Step 3: Validation (5-10 minutes)

```markdown
1. Run tests with Bash
2. Verify file structure
3. Check framework compliance
4. Review integration points
```

**Example**:
```
# Run tests
Bash(
  command="pytest /path/to/tests/test_new_feature.py -v",
  description="Run new feature tests"
)

# Check file structure
Bash(
  command="ls -la /path/to/.claude-library/agents/core/",
  description="Verify new agent file created"
)

# Validate JSON config
Bash(
  command="python3 -m json.tool /path/to/REGISTRY.json > /dev/null",
  description="Validate REGISTRY.json syntax"
)
```

---

### Step 4: Documentation (5 minutes)

```markdown
1. Update relevant documentation
2. Add examples if needed
3. Document integration points
4. Report completion with details
```

---

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Creating New Agent

```markdown
1. Glob to verify agent doesn't exist
2. Read similar agent for pattern
3. Write new agent file with complete definition
4. Read REGISTRY.json
5. Edit REGISTRY.json to add new agent
6. Bash to validate JSON syntax
7. Test agent invocation
```

### Adding Tool to Existing Agent

```markdown
1. Read agent file to get current tools
2. Edit agent file to add tool to list
3. Edit agent file to add tool documentation
4. Read REGISTRY.json to find agent entry
5. Edit REGISTRY.json to update tools array
6. Bash to run tests
```

### Updating Framework Documentation

```markdown
1. Grep to find relevant documentation sections
2. Read those sections to understand context
3. Edit to update content
4. Bash to verify markdown syntax
5. Test that examples still work
```

### Implementing New Workflow

```markdown
1. Read existing workflows for pattern
2. Write new workflow command file
3. Write workflow configuration in REGISTRY.json
4. Create any needed specialized agents
5. Write tests for workflow
6. Bash to run validation
```

---

## Error Handling

**If file doesn't exist**:
1. Verify path is absolute and correct
2. Use Glob to discover correct location
3. Check parent directory exists
4. Create with Write if intentionally new file

**If Edit fails (string not found)**:
1. Read file again to verify current content
2. Check for indentation/whitespace differences
3. Verify old_string is unique (or use replace_all)
4. Check file hasn't changed since last Read

**If tests fail**:
1. Read test output carefully
2. Identify specific failure
3. Read relevant code section
4. Fix with Edit
