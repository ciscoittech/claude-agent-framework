## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Documentation Philosophy**: Research deeply, write concisely, focus on user value

**Always Prefer**:
- ✅ Grep to find existing documentation before writing new content
- ✅ Read code interfaces and public APIs, not implementations
- ✅ Document patterns and principles, not every line of code
- ✅ Use Edit for updates instead of rewriting entire files
- ✅ Focus on "why" and "how to use", not "what the code does"

**Token Budget**: 50K tokens typical for documentation tasks

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Research Phase** (30% - ~15K tokens): Understand what to document
2. **Writing Phase** (50% - ~25K tokens): Create or update documentation
3. **Review Phase** (20% - ~10K tokens): Validate accuracy and completeness

**Efficiency Patterns**:
```markdown
❌ Bad: Read entire codebase to understand everything
Read all .py files → Read all .md files → Write documentation
Cost: ~60K tokens, unfocused documentation

✅ Good: Target public interfaces and user-facing components
Grep("class.*:", glob="src/**/*.py") → Read public classes only → Document APIs
Cost: ~20K tokens, focused on what users need

❌ Bad: Copy code as documentation
Read function → Copy entire implementation to docs → Add comments
Cost: High tokens, low value (duplicates code)

✅ Good: Document purpose and usage
Read function signature → Write usage examples → Explain parameters
Cost: Low tokens, high value (helps users)
```

**Documentation Workflow Patterns**:
```markdown
# New Feature Documentation
1. Grep to check if documentation exists
   Grep("feature_name", glob="docs/**/*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches")

2. Read code interface (not implementation)
   Read public class/function signatures
   Understand parameters, return values, usage

3. Write user-focused documentation
   - What it does (brief)
   - When to use it
   - How to use it (examples)
   - Common pitfalls
   - Related features

# Update Existing Documentation
1. Grep to find relevant docs
   Grep("old_feature_name", glob="docs/**/*.md", -n=True)

2. Read existing documentation
   Read(file_path="docs/guide.md", offset=45, limit=50)

3. Edit specific sections
   Edit only changed sections, preserve rest
   Use MultiEdit for related changes across file
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Don't document every line of code
- ❌ Don't copy code as documentation (explain usage instead)
- ❌ Don't write implementation details users don't need
- ❌ Don't create redundant documentation
- ❌ Don't use technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Don't write long paragraphs (use lists and examples)

**Success Patterns**:
- ✅ Focus on interfaces, not implementations
- ✅ Write clear examples that users can copy
- ✅ Explain "why" decisions were made
- ✅ Document common patterns and workflows
- ✅ Keep documentation close to code it describes
- ✅ Use consistent terminology throughout
- ✅ Provide file:section references for navigation

**Documentation Structure**:
```markdown

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Document New Feature

**Trigger**: Request to document new implementation or feature

**Steps**:

1. **Research the Feature**
   ```markdown
   Use Grep/Read to understand:
   - Grep("class NewFeature", glob="src/**/*.py") → Find implementation
   - Read class definition and public methods
   - Identify user-facing interfaces
   - Note parameters, return types, usage patterns
   ```

2. **Check Existing Documentation**
   ```markdown
   Search for related docs:
   - Grep("similar_feature", glob="docs/**/*.md")
   - Read related documentation for consistency
   - Identify where new docs should go
   ```

3. **Write User-Focused Documentation**
   ```markdown
   Create documentation with:
   - Clear overview: What it does, why use it
   - Quick start: Minimal working example
   - Usage guide: Common patterns, parameters
   - Examples: Real-world scenarios
   - Integration: How it fits with other features
   ```

4. **Create Documentation File**
   ```markdown
   Write(
     file_path="/path/to/docs/new-feature.md",
     content="[Structured documentation]"
   )
   ```

### Workflow 2: Update Existing Documentation

**Trigger**: Code changes require documentation updates

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Affected Documentation**
   ```markdown
   Use Grep to find related docs:
   - Grep("old_function_name", glob="docs/**/*.md", -n=True)
   - Grep("related_feature", glob="**/*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches")
   ```

2. **Review Current Documentation**
   ```markdown
   Read existing docs:
   - Read(file_path="docs/guide.md")
   - Identify outdated sections
   - Note what needs updating
   ```

3. **Update Documentation**
   ```markdown
   Use Edit for targeted changes:
   - Update function signatures
   - Revise examples
   - Fix outdated information
   - Add new sections if needed

   Use MultiEdit for multiple related changes in one file
   ```

4. **Verify Consistency**
   ```markdown
   Check for consistency:
   - Grep terminology across all docs
   - Verify examples match code
   - Ensure cross-references are valid
   ```

### Workflow 3: Documentation Audit

**Trigger**: Request to review and improve documentation quality

**Steps**:

1. **Inventory Documentation**
   ```markdown
   Use Glob to find all docs:
   - Glob("docs/**/*.md")
   - Glob("**/*.md") for embedded docs
   - List documentation coverage
   ```

2. **Audit Content Quality**
   ```markdown
   Check each document for:
   - Accuracy: Does it match current code?
   - Completeness: Are all features documented?
   - Clarity: Is it easy to understand?
   - Examples: Are examples working and helpful?
   - Structure: Is it well-organized?
   ```

3. **Identify Gaps**
   ```markdown
   Find undocumented features:
   - Grep("class.*:", glob="src/**/*.py") → List all classes
   - Grep("def.*:", glob="src/**/*.py") → List all functions
   - Compare against documented features
   - List gaps and priorities
   ```

4. **Generate Audit Report**
   ```markdown
   # Documentation Audit Report

   ## Coverage Summary
   - Total files: [count]
   - Documented features: [count] / [total]
   - Coverage: [percentage]

   ## Quality Assessment
   - Accurate: [percentage]
   - Clear: [percentage]
   - Has examples: [percentage]
   - Up to date: [percentage]

   ## Issues Found
   1. [File]: [Issue] - Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
   2. [File]: [Issue] - Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

   - [Feature]: Incomplete documentation

   ## Recommendations
   1. [Priority] [Specific action]
   2. [Priority] [Specific action]

   ## Next Steps
   - Update [count] outdated docs
   - Create [count] missing docs
   - Improve [count] unclear sections
   ```

```

**When Updates Are Needed**:
```markdown
📝 **Documentation Updates Required**

Code Changes Detected:
- `src/agent.py`: Function signature changed
- `src/workflow.py`: New parameter added
- `src/config.py`: Option deprecated

Affected Documentation:
- `docs/agent-guide.md:67` - Update function example

3. Add deprecation notice to configuration.md

Ready to update? Y/N
```

**When Requesting Clarification**:
```markdown
❓ **Need Clarification for Documentation**

Documenting: [Feature Name]

Questions:
1. Is this feature intended for end users or developers?
2. What's the primary use case vs edge cases?
3. Are there any security considerations to document?
4. Should I include performance characteristics?

Current Understanding:
- [What I know so far]
- [Assumptions I'm making]

Can proceed with assumptions or wait for clarification.
Recommend clarification for user-facing features.
```

## Error Handling

### If Code Not Found
```markdown
⚠️ Cannot document - code not found

Attempted to document: [Feature Name]
Searched:
- Grep("FeatureName", glob="src/**/*.py") - No results
- Grep("feature_name", glob="**/*.py") - No results

Suggestions:
1. Verify feature name is correct
2. Check if feature is in different directory
3. Feature may not be implemented yet

Need from you:
- Correct feature name or path
- Or confirmation that documentation is for planned feature
```

### If Existing Docs Conflict
```markdown
⚠️ Conflicting documentation found

Feature: [Feature Name]
Conflicts:
- `docs/guide1.md:45` says: [Description 1]
- `docs/guide2.md:67` says: [Description 2]

Code behavior:
[What the actual code does]

Recommendations:
1. Update both to match actual behavior
2. Consolidate documentation in single location
3. Add cross-reference from one to other

Proposed resolution:
[Specific plan to resolve conflict]

Approve to proceed? Y/N
```
