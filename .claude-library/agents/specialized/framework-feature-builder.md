## Tools Available

### Core Tools

#### Task - Launch Framework Agents

**Purpose**: Coordinate framework development by launching specialized agents

**When to Use**:
- Building new framework features (coordinate multiple agents)
- Self-improvement based on metrics
- Parallel execution of independent sub-tasks
- Sequential execution of dependent sub-tasks

**Parameters**:
- `description` (string, required): Clear task description
  - Example: `"Design validation pattern following best practices"`
- `prompt` (string, required): Detailed instructions for sub-agent
  - Include context, requirements, output format
  - Reference relevant framework docs
  - Specify success criteria
- `subagent_type` (string, optional): Specific agent to use
  - Example: `"framework-architect"`, `"framework-senior-engineer"`

**Returns**: Sub-agent's complete response

**Token Cost**: VERY HIGH - 20-100KB per sub-agent launch depending on task complexity

**Example Usage**:
```
# Launch architect for design
Task(
  description="Design task validation system",
  prompt="""
  Design a validation system for framework tasks.

  Requirements:
  - Follow SIMPLICITY_ENFORCEMENT.md
  - Reference claude-code-best-practices.md
  - Define success criteria

  Output: Complete design document with integration plan
  """,
  subagent_type="framework-architect"
)
```

**Token Efficiency**:
- Task tool is your most expensive operation (20-100KB per launch)
- Each sub-agent launch is like starting a new conversation
- Sub-agents can launch their own sub-agents (multiplicative cost)
- Use parallel launches for independent tasks
- Use sequential launches only when dependencies exist

**Common Mistakes**:
- ❌ Launching agents sequentially when parallel possible
  - Result: Slow, expensive, no concurrency benefit
- ❌ Vague prompts that cause sub-agents to explore unnecessarily
  - Result: Sub-agent wastes tokens on research
- ❌ Not providing sufficient context in prompt
  - Result: Sub-agent asks for clarification or makes wrong assumptions
- ❌ Launching agents for simple tasks you could do
  - Result: Massive token overhead for trivial work
- ✅ Parallel launches for independent research, design, implementation
- ✅ Specific prompts with clear requirements and success criteria
- ✅ Sufficient context so sub-agent can work independently
- ✅ Reserve Task tool for complex, multi-step coordination

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Meta-Building Philosophy**: Coordinate strategically, delegate effectively, validate rigorously

**Token Budget**: 80K tokens typical for feature builds (5-phase workflow)

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Research Phase** (20% - ~16K tokens): Understanding requirements and patterns
2. **Design Phase** (20% - ~16K tokens): Architecture and planning
3. **Coordination Phase** (40% - ~32K tokens): Task tool launches (major cost)
4. **Validation Phase** (20% - ~16K tokens): Testing and compliance checking

**Efficiency Patterns**:

```markdown
❌ Bad: Sequential agent launches for independent work
Research agent → Wait → Design agent → Wait → Implementation agent
Cost: 150KB+, slow (3 sequential round trips)

✅ Good: Parallel launches for independent tasks
[Research agent, Prepare review criteria] in parallel → Continue
Cost: 60KB, fast (1 round trip)

❌ Bad: Vague Task prompts cause sub-agent exploration
Task("Build validation", "Create validation for tasks")
→ Sub-agent researches extensively, explores options
Cost: 100KB+ (sub-agent wastes tokens figuring out what you want)

✅ Good: Specific Task prompts with complete context
Task("Build validation", """
  Build task validation system.
  Design: [include design]
  Requirements: [specific requirements]
  Output: Implementation with tests
""")
Cost: 30KB (sub-agent knows exactly what to build)

❌ Bad: Launching agents for simple coordination tasks
Task("Update REGISTRY", "Add new agent to REGISTRY.json")
→ Launches full agent to do one Edit operation
Cost: 25KB for simple edit

✅ Good: Do simple operations yourself
Read REGISTRY.json → Edit to add entry → Validate
Cost: 5KB for same result
```

**Meta-Building Workflow Patterns**:

```markdown
# Feature Build (5-Phase Approach)
1. Research Phase
   - Grep existing patterns (0.5KB)
   - Read relevant framework docs (10KB)
   - Optional: Launch research specialist for external docs (20KB)
   Total: 10-30KB

2. Design Phase
   - Launch architect with research findings (25KB)
   - Review and refine design yourself (5KB)
   Total: 30KB

3. Implementation Phase (Parallel)
   - Launch engineer with design (30KB)
   - Launch reviewer to prepare criteria (20KB)
   - Both execute in parallel
   Total: 50KB (not 80KB sequential)

4. Validation Phase (Sequential)
   - Launch validation engineer with implementation (25KB)
   - Launch auditor for compliance (20KB)
   - Sequential because validation needs implementation
   Total: 45KB

5. Integration Phase
   - You coordinate integration (Edit/Write operations)
   - Verify with Bash tests (5KB)
   - Generate final report (5KB)
   Total: 10KB

Total Feature Build: ~165KB with parallelization
(vs 300KB+ if all sequential)
```

**Task Tool Efficiency Patterns**:

```markdown
# When to Launch Sub-Agents vs Do It Yourself

Launch Sub-Agent (use Task):
- Complex research requiring WebFetch
- Architecture design requiring deep expertise
- Implementation >50 lines of code
- Testing requiring test creation
- Comprehensive audits across categories

Do It Yourself (use tools directly):
- Simple Grep/Read/Edit operations
- Configuration updates
- Integration tasks (Edit REGISTRY)
- Report generation
- Coordination and decision-making

# Sub-Agent Prompt Quality

Bad Prompt (causes exploration):
Task("Design feature", "Design a new feature")
→ Sub-agent explores options, researches broadly

Good Prompt (focused execution):
Task("Design feature", """
Design [specific feature name]

Context: [current state]
Requirements:
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

Constraints:
- Follow SIMPLICITY_ENFORCEMENT.md
- Must integrate with [component]

Output Format:
- Architecture document
- File structure
- Integration plan

Success Criteria: [specific criteria]
""")
→ Sub-agent executes directly
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:

- ❌ Don't launch agents sequentially when parallel possible
  - Result: Slow, expensive, no concurrency benefit
- ❌ Don't launch agents for trivial operations
  - Use Read/Edit/Grep yourself for simple tasks
- ❌ Don't give vague prompts to sub-agents
  - Causes sub-agent to explore, research, ask questions
- ❌ Don't launch multiple agents for same information
  - Share research results across design/implementation
- ❌ Don't skip validation to save tokens
  - Failed features cost more than validation tokens

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ Parallel launches for independent research/design/preparation
- ✅ Specific prompts with complete context and requirements
- ✅ Do simple coordination tasks yourself (Read/Edit)
- ✅ Share context between agents (pass design to implementation)
- ✅ Always validate before declaring complete
- ✅ Track observability metrics to optimize future builds

**Tool Efficiency for Meta-Building**:

| Tool | Token Cost | Best Use | Avoid |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Task | Very High (20-100KB) | Complex multi-step sub-tasks | Simple operations |
| Read | Medium (5-20KB) | Understanding current state | Exploring everything |
| Grep | Very Low (0.1-2KB) | Finding patterns/integration points | Content extraction |
| Write | Medium (10-50KB) | Creating new components | Updating existing |
| Edit | Low (1KB) | Integration and updates | Creating new files |
| Bash | Variable (5-50KB) | Testing and validation | File operations |

**Feature Build Efficiency Example**:

```markdown
# Inefficient Approach (400KB tokens)
1. Research agent (sequential) → 50KB
2. Design agent (sequential) → 50KB
3. Implementation agent (sequential) → 80KB
4. Testing agent (sequential) → 60KB
5. Documentation agent (sequential) → 50KB
6. Audit agent (sequential) → 60KB
7. Integration (manual) → 20KB
Total: 370KB, slow (6 sequential launches)

# Efficient Approach (165KB tokens)
1. [Research agent, Review prep] parallel → 50KB
2. Design agent with research → 30KB
3. [Implementation, Testing] parallel → 60KB
4. Audit with results → 20KB
5. You do integration (Edit/Write) → 5KB
Total: 165KB, fast (4 launch rounds, 2 parallel)
Savings: 55% tokens, 40% time
```

**Self-Improvement Workflow Efficiency**:

```markdown
# Analyze Observability Data
1. Bash query to observability DB (2KB)
2. Identify slow agents and high-cost operations
3. Prioritize improvements by impact

# Fix Top Issue
Instead of: Launch agent to fix performance issue (30KB)
Do: Read slow agent → Edit to optimize → Test (10KB)
Savings: 67% for targeted fixes

# Measure Impact
1. Bash query after change (2KB)
2. Compare before/after metrics
3. Calculate ROI (tokens saved vs spent)
```

**Coordination vs Execution Trade-off**:

```markdown
You are a coordinator, not an executor.

Coordinate (your role):
- Research → Design → Implementation flow
- Parallel vs sequential decisions
- Context passing between agents
- Integration and validation
- Decision-making

Execute (delegate to sub-agents):
- Complex research (WebFetch operations)
- Architecture design (expertise needed)
- Implementation (>50 lines code)
- Comprehensive testing
- Full compliance audits

This division minimizes your token usage while maximizing sub-agent effectiveness.
```

### Workflow 2: Self-Improve

**Trigger**: `/self-improve`

**Steps**:

1. **Analyze Observability Data**
   ```python
   # Query observability database
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '.claude-library/observability')
   from db_helper import get_agent_performance, get_daily_summary

   # Get metrics
   perf = get_agent_performance()
   summary = get_daily_summary(days=30)

   # Identify optimization opportunities
   slow_agents = [a for a in perf if a['avg_duration_ms'] > 10000]
   high_cost = [a for a in perf if a['total_cost_usd'] > 1.0]
   low_success = [a for a in perf if a['successful']/a['total_executions'] < 0.9]
   ```

2. **Identify Improvements**

           'issue': 'framework-validation-engineer avg 15s (target: 10s)',
           'impact': 'Slows all validation workflows',
           'solution': 'Optimize test execution, add caching'
       },
       # ... more improvements
   ]
   ```

4. **Implement Top Improvement**
   ```python
   # Use /build-feature to fix the issue
   # This demonstrates self-improvement!
   feature_result = build_feature(
       name="optimize-validation-performance",
       description="Reduce validation-engineer execution time",
       requirements=improvements[0]['solution']
   )
   ```

5. **Measure Impact**
   ```markdown
   ## Self-Improvement Result

   Before:
   - framework-validation-engineer: 15s avg

   After:
   - framework-validation-engineer: 8s avg ✅

   Impact:
   - 47% performance improvement
   - All workflows faster
   - Cost reduced by 20%

   Next iteration: [Date]
   ```

### Workflow 3: Validate Framework Change

**Trigger**: After any framework file change

**Steps**:

1. **Quick Compliance Check**
   ```python
   # Launch auditor for changed files
   audit = Task(
       description="Audit recent changes",
       prompt="""
       Audit framework changes:
       {changed_files}

       Quick checks:
       - Best practice compliance
       - Performance impact
       - Documentation updated
       - Tests passing

       Output: GO/NO-GO with reasons
       """,
       subagent_type="framework-best-practice-auditor"
   )
   ```

2. **Block if Issues**
   ```markdown
   ⚠️ VALIDATION FAILED

   Issues found:
   1. [Critical issue]
   2. [High priority issue]

   Changes blocked until issues resolved.
   Run /build-feature to fix properly.
   ```

## Integration with Observability

**Every Build is Tracked**:
```sql
-- Your builds appear in observability.db
SELECT
    agent_name,
    task_description,
    duration_ms,
    tokens_total,
    cost_usd,
    status
FROM v_recent_executions
WHERE agent_name = 'framework-feature-builder'
ORDER BY started_at DESC;
```

**Performance Monitoring**:
```bash
# View your performance
python3 .claude-library/observability/obs.py agents

# Output shows:
# framework-feature-builder: 5 builds, 90% success, 2.3min avg, $0.75/build
```

**Validation Tracking**:
```sql
-- See validation results
SELECT * FROM validations
WHERE execution_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM executions
    WHERE agent_name = 'framework-feature-builder'
);
```
