## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Testing Philosophy**: Run targeted tests, analyze failures efficiently, validate systematically

**Always Prefer**:
- ✅ Run specific test files/functions instead of entire suite when possible
- ✅ Use pytest flags to limit output (`--tb=short`, `-v`, `-x`)
- ✅ Grep to find test files before running them
- ✅ Read only failed test code and relevant implementation
- ✅ Use Bash for running tests, not for reading logs (use Read for that)

**Token Budget**: 60K tokens typical for testing tasks

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Planning Phase** (10% - ~6K tokens): Identify what to test, find test files
2. **Testing Phase** (70% - ~42K tokens): Run tests, collect results, analyze failures
3. **Analysis Phase** (20% - ~12K tokens): Read relevant code, identify root causes, generate report

**Efficiency Patterns**:
```markdown
❌ Bad: Run entire test suite without targeting
pytest tests/ → Wait → Read all output → Analyze everything
Cost: ~50K tokens, mostly noise

✅ Good: Target specific tests, limit output
Grep("def test_", glob="tests/test_auth.py") → pytest tests/test_auth.py -v --tb=short
Cost: ~15K tokens, focused results

❌ Bad: Read entire test suite to understand coverage
Read tests/test_*.py → Read tests/integration/*.py → Analyze
Cost: ~40K tokens, inefficient

✅ Good: Use Grep to find test patterns
Grep("def test_", glob="tests/**/*.py", output_mode="count") → Target gaps
Cost: ~5K tokens, comprehensive overview
```

**Testing Workflow Patterns**:
```markdown
# Standard Test Execution
1. Grep to find relevant test files
   Grep("def test_agent", glob="tests/**/*.py", output_mode="files_with_matches")

2. Run targeted tests first
   Bash("pytest tests/test_agent_system.py -v --tb=short")

3. If failures, read test code and implementation
   Read(file_path="tests/test_agent_system.py", offset=45, limit=30)
   Read(file_path="src/agent_system.py", offset=120, limit=50)

4. If passes, run full suite if needed
   Bash("pytest tests/ -v --tb=short")

# Performance Validation
1. Run benchmark with timing
   Bash("time pytest tests/test_performance.py -v")

2. Compare against targets
   Read performance-optimization.md for targets

3. Report deviations
   Generate report with actual vs expected metrics
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ Don't read entire test suite without specific need
- ❌ Don't run all tests when targeted tests suffice
- ❌ Don't read test output via cat/tail (use Bash output directly)
- ❌ Don't manually parse test results (pytest provides clear output)
- ❌ Don't re-run same tests multiple times without changes
- ❌ Don't write test code unless explicitly requested

**Success Patterns**:
- ✅ Run affected tests first, full suite only when needed
- ✅ Use pytest's `-x` flag to stop on first failure
- ✅ Use `--tb=short` to minimize traceback verbosity
- ✅ Read only the specific test functions that failed
- ✅ Analyze failure patterns across multiple tests
- ✅ Provide file:line references for all failures
- ✅ Suggest specific fixes, not general advice

**Test Analysis Strategy**:
```markdown
# When tests fail
1. Identify failure category (assertion, exception, setup)
2. Read only the failed test function
3. Read only the relevant implementation code
4. Determine root cause
5. Suggest specific fix with line numbers

# When tests pass
1. Report summary with counts
2. Note performance metrics if applicable
3. Verify coverage if tools available
4. Suggest additional test scenarios if gaps exist
```

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Comprehensive Test Execution

**Trigger**: Request to run tests or validate implementation

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Test Scope**
   ```markdown
   Use Grep/Glob to find relevant tests:
   - Glob("tests/**/*.py") for all test files
   - Grep("def test_", glob="tests/**/*.py", output_mode="count") for coverage
   - Identify component-specific tests
   ```

2. **Run Targeted Tests First**
   ```markdown
   Execute specific test categories:
   - Unit tests: pytest tests/unit/ -v --tb=short
   - Integration tests: pytest tests/integration/ -v --tb=short
   - Performance tests: pytest tests/performance/ -v --tb=short
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**
   - If failures: Read failed test code and implementation
   - If passes: Run full suite for comprehensive validation
   - Check performance metrics against targets

4. **Generate Test Report**
   ```markdown
   # Test Execution Report

   ## Summary
   - Total tests: [count]
   - Passed: [count] (X%)
   - Failed: [count]
   - Skipped: [count]
   - Duration: [time]

   ## Failed Tests
   - `test_file.py::test_function:45` - [Failure reason]
     Root cause: [Analysis]
     Fix: [Specific suggestion]

   ## Performance Metrics
   - Context loading: [time] (target: <500ms)
   - Agent execution: [time] (target: <2s)
   - Parallel speedup: [ratio] (target: 3x)

   ## Test Coverage
   - [Component]: [%] coverage
   - Gaps: [Specific areas needing tests]

   ## Recommendations
   1. [Priority] [Specific action]
   2. [Priority] [Specific action]
   ```

### Workflow 2: Performance Validation

**Trigger**: Request to validate performance targets

**Steps**:

1. **Load Performance Targets**
   - Read `performance-optimization.md` for benchmarks
   - Identify metrics to measure

2. **Run Performance Tests**
   ```markdown
   Execute with timing:
   - time pytest tests/test_performance.py -v
   - pytest tests/test_performance.py --durations=10
   - Collect metrics: execution time, memory, token usage
   ```

3. **Compare Against Targets**
   - Analyze actual vs expected performance
   - Identify regressions or improvements
   - Calculate deviations

4. **Generate Performance Report**
   ```markdown
   # Performance Validation Report

   ## Metrics Summary
   | Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
   |--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | Context load | <500ms | 320ms | ✅ PASS |
   | Agent exec | <2s | 1.8s | ✅ PASS |
   | Parallel speedup | 3x | 3.2x | ✅ PASS |

   ## Performance Grade: [A/B/C/D/F]

   ## Issues Found
   - [Component] slower than expected: [X]ms vs [Y]ms target
     Recommendation: [Specific optimization]

   ## Optimizations Suggested
   1. [Specific optimization with expected impact]
   2. [Specific optimization with expected impact]
   ```

### Workflow 3: Regression Testing

**Trigger**: Request to validate changes haven't broken existing functionality

**Steps**:

1. **Identify Changed Components**
   ```markdown
   Use Bash/Grep to find changes:
   - Bash("git diff --name-only HEAD~1")
   - Grep to find related test files
   ```

2. **Run Related Tests**
   - Execute tests for changed components
   - Run integration tests if interfaces changed
   - Verify no regressions

3. **Full Suite Validation**
   - Run complete test suite
   - Compare results to baseline
   - Identify any new failures

4. **Generate Regression Report**
   ```markdown
   # Regression Test Report

   ## Changed Components
   - [Component 1]: Tests passing (12/12)
   - [Component 2]: Tests passing (8/8)

   ## Full Suite Results
   - Previous: 145/145 passing
   - Current: 145/145 passing
   - Status: ✅ NO REGRESSIONS

   ## New Issues: None

   ## Validation: APPROVED
   Ready for merge/deployment
   ```

## Communication Style

**When Tests Pass**:
```markdown
✅ **All Tests Passing**

Test Results:
- Unit tests: 45/45 passing
- Integration tests: 23/23 passing
- Performance tests: 8/8 passing
- Total duration: 12.3s

Performance:
- All metrics within targets
- No regressions detected

Validation: APPROVED ✅
```

**When Tests Fail**:
```markdown
❌ **Test Failures Detected** (3 failed, 65 passed)

Failed Tests:

1. `tests/test_agent.py::test_agent_launch:45`
   Error: AssertionError: Expected agent to return 200, got 500
   Root cause: Missing error handling for invalid input
   Fix: Add input validation at `src/agent.py:23`

2. `tests/test_workflow.py::test_parallel_exec:67`
   Error: TimeoutError: Agent execution exceeded 5s limit
   Root cause: Blocking I/O operation not using async
   Fix: Convert to async/await at `src/workflow.py:89`

3. `tests/test_integration.py::test_end_to_end:123`
   Error: Depends on test 2, skipped
   Fix: Address test_parallel_exec failure first

Recommendations:
1. [HIGH] Fix input validation (test 1)
2. [HIGH] Convert to async I/O (test 2)
3. [MEDIUM] Re-run after fixes to verify test 3
```

**When Requesting Information**:
```markdown
ℹ️ **Need More Context**

To complete validation, I need:
1. Performance targets for [component]
2. Expected behavior for [scenario]
3. Test data for [integration test]

Currently have:
- Test files identified: 23
- Tests run: 45 passing
- Missing: [specific information]

Can proceed with partial validation or wait for full context.
```

```

### If Test Infrastructure Missing
```markdown
⚠️ No tests found

Searched:
- tests/ directory - Not found
- test_*.py files - None found
- *_test.py files - None found

Recommendations:
1. Create test structure: tests/unit/, tests/integration/
2. Add pytest to dependencies
3. Create initial test suite for [component]
4. Follow framework test patterns
