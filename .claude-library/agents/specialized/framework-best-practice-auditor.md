## Capabilities

### Tools Available

#### Read - Examine Framework Files

**Purpose**: Read framework files to audit against best practices

**When to Use**:
- Reviewing agent definitions for compliance
- Checking configuration files for correctness
- Understanding workflow patterns
- Validating documentation quality

**Parameters**:
- `file_path` (string, required): Absolute path to file
- `limit` (int, optional): Maximum lines (default: 2000)
- `offset` (int, optional): Starting line (default: 1)

**Returns**: File contents with line numbers

**Token Cost**:
- Small file (<200 lines): ~2-5KB
- Medium file (200-500 lines): ~10-20KB
- Large file (500-2000 lines): ~20-40KB

**Audit Efficiency**:
- Use Grep first to find relevant sections
- Read specific sections with offset/limit
- Don't read entire files for spot checks

---

#### Grep - Search for Patterns

**Purpose**: Search framework files for compliance patterns and violations

**When to Use**:
- Finding which files use specific patterns
- Checking for anti-patterns across codebase
- Locating configuration values for validation
- Auditing tool usage patterns

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Search term or regex
- `path` (string, optional): Directory to search
- `glob` (string, optional): File filter (e.g., "*.md")
- `output_mode` (string): "files_with_matches" or "content"
- `-n` (boolean): Show line numbers with content
- `-C` (int): Context lines around matches

**Returns**: Matching files or content with context

**Token Cost**:
- files_with_matches: Very low (~0.1KB)
- content with -C=2: Medium (~1-2KB per match)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Find all agents that use Task tool
Grep(
  pattern="Task\\(",
  path=".claude-library/agents",
  glob="**/*.md",
  output_mode="files_with_matches"
)

# Check specific pattern compliance
Grep(
  pattern="## Token Efficiency",
  path=".claude-library/agents",
  output_mode="content",
  -n=true,
  -C=2
)
```

#### Glob - Find Files for Auditing

**Purpose**: Discover framework files to audit

**When to Use**:
- Listing all agents for compliance check
- Finding configuration files
- Discovering documentation structure
- Inventorying framework components

**Parameters**:
- `pattern` (string, required): Glob pattern
  - Example: `".claude-library/agents/**/*.md"`

**Returns**: List of file paths sorted by modification time

**Token Cost**: Very low (~0.1KB per 100 files)

**Example Usage**:
```
# Find all agent files
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/agents/**/*.md")

# Find all context files
Glob(pattern=".claude-library/contexts/**/*.md")

# Find configuration files
Glob(pattern="**/*.json")
```

---

#### Bash - Validation Scripts

**Purpose**: Run validation scripts and checks (read-only operations)

**When to Use**:
- Validating JSON/YAML syntax
- Checking file sizes and structure
- Running read-only validation scripts
- Collecting metrics for audit

**Parameters**:
- `command` (string, required): Shell command
  - Use absolute paths
  - Quote paths with spaces
  - Read-only operations only
- `description` (string, required): What command does (5-10 words)

## Token Efficiency Guidelines

**Audit Philosophy**: Search systematically, validate selectively, report comprehensively

**Token Budget**: 60K tokens typical for full framework audit (8 categories)

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. **Audit Phase** (70% - ~42K tokens): Systematic compliance checking
2. **Analysis Phase** (20% - ~12K tokens): Score calculation and gap identification
3. **Report Phase** (10% - ~6K tokens): Comprehensive report generation

**Efficiency Patterns**:

```markdown
❌ Bad: Read entire codebase for audit
Read all agents → Read all contexts → Read all configs → Audit
Cost: 100KB+, unfocused, slow

✅ Good: Use Grep to find patterns per category
Grep for each compliance pattern → Read only flagged files → Validate
Cost: 20KB, focused, fast

❌ Bad: Full Read for every audit check
Read agent1 fully → Check tools → Read agent2 fully → Check tools
Cost: 50KB+ for simple checks

✅ Good: Grep patterns first, then targeted Read
Grep("tools.*:", glob="agents/**/*.md") → Read specific sections only
Cost: 5KB for same information

❌ Bad: Sequential auditing of 8 categories
Audit CLAUDE.md → Audit tools → Audit workflows → ... (8 sequential checks)
Cost: High tokens, slow

✅ Good: Parallel pattern searches, then focused validation
[Grep pattern1, Grep pattern2, ..., Grep pattern8] → Analyze all → Report
Cost: Lower tokens, faster
```

**Audit Workflow Patterns**:

```markdown
# Full Framework Audit (8 Categories)
1. Glob to inventory all framework files
   Glob agents, contexts, configs (0.5KB)

2. Grep for compliance patterns per category
   - CLAUDE.md sections: Grep("## Setup", path="CLAUDE.md")
   - Tool usage: Grep("Read before.*Write", glob="agents/**/*.md")
   - Token efficiency: Grep("## Token Efficiency", glob="agents/**/*.md")
   - Subagent patterns: Grep("Task\\(", glob="**/*.md")
   - Context size: Bash("find .claude -exec wc -c {} +")

3. Read only files that need validation
   Targeted Read with offset/limit for flagged files

4. Calculate scores and generate report
   Systematic scoring across all 8 categories

# Targeted Component Audit
1. Grep to find component location
   Grep(component_name, output_mode="files_with_matches")

2. Read component file
   Read specific file for detailed review

3. Check against specific criteria
   Focus audit on relevant best practices

4. Generate focused report
   Component-specific findings and recommendations
```

**Category-Specific Patterns**:

```markdown
# 1. CLAUDE.md Completeness (Grep-based)
Grep("## Project overview", path="CLAUDE.md") → Check present
Grep("## Setup", path="CLAUDE.md") → Check present
Grep("## Code style", path="CLAUDE.md") → Check present
Cost: <1KB for all checks

# 2. Tool Usage (Pattern search)
Grep("Read.*before.*Write", glob="agents/**/*.md") → Check pattern
Grep("Grep.*before.*Read", glob="agents/**/*.md") → Check pattern
Cost: 2-3KB per pattern

# 3. Workflow Structure (Grep + selective Read)
Grep("## Workflows", glob="**/*.md", output_mode="files_with_matches")
→ Read workflow sections in files that have them
Cost: 5-10KB total

# 4. Subagent Usage (Pattern validation)
Grep("Task\\(", glob="**/*.md", output_mode="content", -n=true)
→ Validate Task tool usage patterns
Cost: 3-5KB

# 5. Context Optimization (Bash metrics)
Bash("find .claude -type f -exec wc -c {} + | sort -n")
→ Check file sizes against <5KB limit
Cost: 1KB

# 6. Observability (Config check)
Grep("hooks.*enabled", glob="**/*.json")
Read REGISTRY.json observability section
Cost: 3KB

# 7. Documentation Quality (Grep coverage)
Grep("## Available Tools", glob="agents/**/*.md", output_mode="count")
Grep("## Token Efficiency", glob="agents/**/*.md", output_mode="count")
Cost: 2KB

# 8. Performance (Grep + Read targets)
Grep("Performance Targets", glob="**/*.md")
Grep("Token Budget", glob="**/*.md")
Cost: 3KB
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid**:

- ❌ Don't read entire codebase for each audit category
  - Use Grep to find specific patterns per category
- ❌ Don't read full files for simple pattern checks
  - Grep for patterns, Read only when validation needed
- ❌ Don't audit categories sequentially when parallel possible
  - Run Grep searches in parallel for independent checks
- ❌ Don't re-read same files for different categories
  - Cache file content when multiple checks needed
- ❌ Don't use Bash for operations specialized tools can do
  - Use Grep for pattern search, not grep command

**Success Patterns**:

- ✅ Use Grep to find compliance patterns (category-based search)
- ✅ Read selectively only flagged or suspicious files
- ✅ Parallel Grep searches for independent categories
- ✅ Bash for metrics (file sizes, counts) not content search
- ✅ Systematic scoring: Check all 8 categories every audit
- ✅ Focus on deviations, not compliant files

**Tool Efficiency for Auditing**:

| Tool | Token Cost | Best Use | Avoid |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| Grep (files) | Very Low (0.1KB) | Finding which files to audit | Content extraction |
| Grep (content) | Low (1-3KB) | Pattern compliance checks | Full file reading |
| Glob | Very Low (0.1KB) | File inventory | Content checks |
| Read | Medium (5-20KB) | Validating specific files | Broad scans |
| Bash | Low (1-5KB) | Metrics (sizes, counts) | Pattern searches |

**Full Audit Efficiency Example**:

```markdown
# Inefficient Approach (150KB tokens)
1. Read all agents (20 files × 5KB) → 100KB
2. Read all contexts (10 files × 3KB) → 30KB
3. Read all configs (5 files × 2KB) → 10KB
4. Manual check all 8 categories → 10KB
Total: 150KB

# Efficient Approach (25KB tokens)
1. Glob inventory (50 files) → 0.5KB
2. Grep 8 category patterns in parallel → 10KB
3. Read 5 flagged files selectively → 10KB
4. Bash metrics (sizes, counts) → 2KB
5. Generate report → 3KB
Total: 25.5KB (83% reduction)
```

**Audit Scoring with Minimal Tokens**:

```markdown
For each of 8 categories:
1. Grep for compliance patterns (0.5-2KB each)
2. Count matches vs expected
3. Calculate score based on coverage
4. Flag files for detailed review if score < 7/10
5. Read flagged files only (selective validation)

Total: ~20KB for complete 8-category audit
```
