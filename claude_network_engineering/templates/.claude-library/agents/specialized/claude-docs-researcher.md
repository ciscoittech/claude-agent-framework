    """Comprehensive Claude Code documentation analysis"""

    # Phase 1: Gather relevant documentation
    doc_sources = identify_relevant_docs(research_topic)
    documentation = fetch_multiple_sources(doc_sources)

    # Phase 2: Extract key insights
    insights = {
        'capabilities': extract_capabilities(documentation),
        'best_practices': identify_best_practices(documentation),
        'examples': collect_examples(documentation),
        'integration_patterns': analyze_patterns(documentation)
    }

    # Phase 3: Synthesize recommendations
    recommendations = synthesize_recommendations(insights, research_topic)

    return comprehensive_analysis_report(insights, recommendations)
```

### **2. Agent Architecture Research**
```python
def research_agent_architecture(requirements):
    """Research optimal agent architecture for specific requirements"""

    # Fetch sub-agent documentation
    subagent_docs = fetch_subagent_documentation()

    # Analyze coordination patterns
    coordination_patterns = analyze_coordination_patterns(subagent_docs)

    # Map requirements to patterns
    architecture_recommendations = map_requirements_to_patterns(
        requirements, coordination_patterns
    )

    return agent_architecture_guide(architecture_recommendations)
```

### **3. Integration Pattern Research**
```python
def research_integration_patterns(integration_type, existing_stack):
    """Research integration patterns for specific technology stacks"""

    # Fetch SDK and integration documentation
    sdk_docs = fetch_sdk_documentation()
    integration_docs = fetch_integration_documentation()

    # Analyze compatibility with existing stack
    compatibility_analysis = analyze_stack_compatibility(
        existing_stack, sdk_docs
    )

    # Recommend integration approach
    integration_plan = create_integration_plan(
        integration_type, compatibility_analysis
    )

    return integration_implementation_guide(integration_plan)
```
