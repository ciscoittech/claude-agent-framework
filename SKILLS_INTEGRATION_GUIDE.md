## Quick Start: 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Understand the Concept (1 min)
Skills are reusable, modular capabilities that Claude uses automatically when relevant. Think of them as "expertise packages" your framework can load.

### Step 2: See Available Skills (1 min)
```
Current framework skills:
├── agent-launcher/        - Intelligently select and launch agents
├── doc-builder/           - Generate API docs and user guides
├── codebase-analyzer/     - Analyze project structure
├── simplicity-enforcer/   - Validate circuit breaker rules
└── code-generator/        - Generate code from templates
```

### Step 3: Enable Skills (1 min)
Add to your `.claude-library/REGISTRY.json`:
```json
{
  "settings": {
    "skills": {
      "enabled": true,
      "installed": [
        "agent-launcher:1.0",
        "doc-builder:1.0"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Use a Skill (2 min)
```
You: "Create API documentation for our REST endpoints"

Claude will automatically:
1. Recognize this matches Documentation Builder skill
2. Load the skill's metadata (30-50 words)
3. Use the skill to analyze your code
4. Generate professional API documentation
```

---

## What Problems Do Skills Solve?

### Problem 1: Setup Takes Too Long
**Before**: 45-60 minutes to set up framework
**With Skills**: 5-10 minutes

Skills provide templates and auto-setup capabilities.

### Problem 2: Context Overhead
**Before**: All agent configs loaded upfront (~15KB context)
**With Skills**: Progressive disclosure (~500 bytes metadata + on-demand)

Result: 70-90% less context needed.

### Problem 3: Limited Reusability
**Before**: Agents tied to specific projects
**With Skills**: Share skills across projects/teams

Skills are portable ZIP packages.

### Problem 4: Community Contributions
**Before**: Difficult to contribute patterns to framework
**With Skills**: Easy to create and share custom skills

Skills can be uploaded and shared.

## Understanding Skills vs Agents

### Skills Are Like...
- **Textbooks**: Contain knowledge and instructions
- **Templates**: Reusable patterns
- **Specifications**: Describe what Claude should do
- **Packages**: Portable modules

### Agents Are Like...
- **Experts**: Execute complex tasks
- **Tools**: Perform actions
- **Services**: Available when called
- **Workers**: Get tasks done

### How They Work Together

```
Skill → Recipe/Specification
Agent → Chef/Executor
User → Customer

User says "I want documentation"
  ↓
Documentation Builder Skill recognizes the need
  ↓
Skill provides specification/template
  ↓
Documentation Expert Agent executes the task
  ↓
Result: Professional documentation
```

**What it does**: Generates API docs, user guides, architecture documentation

**When to use**:
```
"Create API documentation for our REST endpoints"
"Write a getting started guide for new developers"
"Document our microservices architecture"
```

**Outputs**:
- Markdown documentation
- OpenAPI specifications
- HTML versions
- PDF downloads

**Context efficiency**: Progressive (analyze → select format → generate)

### 3. Codebase Analyzer Skill (Coming in Phase 2)
**What it does**: Analyzes project structure and recommends framework configuration

**Benefits**:
- Automatic project analysis

## Migrating from Framework v1.0 to v1.1

### Do Nothing (Fully Compatible)
✅ Your existing v1.0 setup continues working
✅ No forced upgrades
✅ Use v1.1 features gradually

### Option 1: Gradual Adoption
1. Keep existing agents working
2. Start using skills for new tasks
3. Migrate agents one at a time
4. Eventually full skills-based setup

### Option 2: Full Migration
1. Run migration command (coming in Phase 1)
2. Framework auto-converts agents to skills
3. Creates new `.claude-library/skills/` folder
4. Updates REGISTRY.json

### Option 3: Hybrid Setup
Keep some agents, use skills for other tasks
- ✅ Agents for complex logic
- ✅ Skills for setup and templates
- ✅ Both can coexist peacefully

**Recommended**: Option 1 (Gradual adoption)

## Creating Your Own Skills

### Minimal Skill Structure
```
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
    ---
    name: "My Skill Name"
    description: "What this skill does (max 200 chars)"
    ---
    # Instructions here...
```

### Recommended Skill Structure
```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions
├── REFERENCE.md          # Detailed reference
├── examples.json         # Usage examples
├── scripts/              # Executable code
│   └── helper.py
└── templates/            # Templates/examples
    └── template.md
```

### Framework Skill Conventions

**Naming**:
- Use descriptive names: `doc-builder`, `code-generator`
- Include "-skill" suffix for clarity
- Use lowercase with hyphens

**Description** (Critical for Claude to use skill):
```yaml
description: "Generates professional API documentation from REST endpoints,
including OpenAPI specs, examples in multiple languages, and formatted HTML/PDF"
```

### Skill Template

```yaml
---
name: "Skill Display Name"
description: "Clear, specific description of what this skill does (max 200 chars)"
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
What this skill is for and when to use it.

## How to Use
Step-by-step instructions for Claude on using this skill.

## Examples
Concrete examples of using the skill.

## Advanced Features
Optional advanced capabilities.

## Reference
Link to REFERENCE.md for technical details.
```

### Publishing Your Skill

1. **Local**: Place in `.claude-library/skills/`
2. **Project**: Share as ZIP in your GitHub
3. **Community**: Submit to framework repository
4. **Official**: Contribute to anthropics/skills

---

## Skills vs Alternatives

### When to Use Skills
✅ Packaging reusable patterns
✅ Creating templates
✅ Auto-selection logic
✅ Portable expertise
✅ Community sharing

### When to Use Agents Instead
✅ Complex multi-step workflows
✅ Need external API access
✅ Custom tool execution
✅ Stateful execution

### When to Use MCP Servers
✅ Long-lived external services
✅ Network access required
✅ Complex integrations
✅ Enterprise systems

**Simple rule**: Skills first, then agents, then MCP if needed

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Claude Doesn't Use My Skill

**Likely causes**:
1. Description not clear enough
2. Skill not installed in REGISTRY.json
3. Skill metadata not matching task

**Solution**:
```yaml
# ❌ Vague
description: "Data processing"

# ✅ Clear
description: "Converts CSV data to formatted Excel spreadsheets
with formulas, charts, and financial formatting"
```

### Issue: Skill Context Too Large

**Solution**: Use progressive disclosure
1. Keep YAML metadata minimal (30-50 words)
2. Put detailed info in REFERENCE.md
3. Let Claude load references on demand

### Issue: Skill Not Found

**Solution**: Check installation
```json
// .claude-library/REGISTRY.json
{
  "settings": {
    "skills": {
      "enabled": true,
      "installed": [
        "agent-launcher:1.0",  // Make sure skills are listed
        "doc-builder:1.0"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Issue: Wrong Agent Selected

**Solution**: Be more specific
```
❌ "Use Agent Launcher to work on this"
✅ "Use Agent Launcher to implement OAuth2 authentication module"
```

---

## Performance Tips

### Skill Selection Optimization
- Clear descriptions = better matching
- Specific task descriptions = correct agent
- Progressive disclosure = fast loading

### Token Efficiency
- YAML metadata only: ~500 tokens
- Main instructions: 2K-4K tokens
- References loaded on demand: 1K-8K tokens

**Result**: 70-90% less context than loading full configs upfront

### Best Practices
1. Keep initial descriptions focused (50-200 chars)
2. Use REFERENCE.md for detailed content
3. Organize content by usage frequency
4. Cache project analysis results

---

## Success Metrics

### For Your Projects
- Setup time: Track before/after
- Context size: Monitor token usage
- Agent selection accuracy: Check first-agent-correct rate
- Documentation quality: Review generated docs

### For Framework Adoption
- Time to first skill use: Aim for < 5 minutes
- Skill reuse across projects: Track reuse rate
- Community contributions: Monitor skill submissions
- User satisfaction: Gather feedback

---

## Examples & Case Studies

### Case Study 1: New Project Setup
