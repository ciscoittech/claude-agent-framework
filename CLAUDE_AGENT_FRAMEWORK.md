## Introduction

This framework enables you to build sophisticated multi-agent development systems using Claude Code's capabilities. Based on proven patterns from production systems, it emphasizes **performance through minimal context loading**, **parallel agent execution**, and **clear workflow orchestration**.

### Key Benefits
- **97% reduction** in auto-loaded context (250KB → 8KB)
- **3x faster execution** through parallel agent processing
- **Project-agnostic** - works with any tech stack
- **Progressive complexity** - start simple, scale as needed

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Minimal Auto-Loading
Only load what's essential at startup:
- `.claude/` folder contains minimal configuration (< 10KB)
- `.claude-library/` holds all agents, contexts, and commands
- Dynamic loading based on task requirements

### 2. Agent Specialization
Each agent has:
- **Single responsibility** (architecture OR implementation OR review)
- **Clear boundaries** (what it should and shouldn't do)
- **Defined tools** (only the tools it needs)
- **Explicit triggers** (keywords that activate it)

### 3. Workflow-Driven Development
Commands orchestrate agents through defined workflows:
- **Sequential**: One agent completes before the next starts
- **Parallel**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Hierarchical**: Parent agents spawn child agents

### The Agent Launcher

The `agent-launcher.md` is your system's brain. It:
1. **Analyzes** user requests to determine intent
2. **Loads** appropriate agents from the library
3. **Routes** tasks to the right agents
4. **Manages** context loading dynamically

```markdown
# Agent Launcher

You are the agent launcher for [PROJECT NAME]. Your role is to:
1. Parse user requests to determine intent
2. Load appropriate agents from `.claude-library/`
3. Route tasks to correct agents
4. Manage context loading as needed

## Quick Commands
- `/feature "description"` - Build new feature
- `/debug "issue"` - Debug problems
- `/review` - Review code

## Loading Strategy
1. If input starts with `/`, load from `.claude/commands/`
2. Match keywords to agents in REGISTRY.json
3. Load relevant contexts based on task
```

## Agent Design Principles

### Agent Definition Structure

Every agent should follow this template:

```markdown
# [Agent Name]

You are a [role] specializing in [domain]. Your expertise includes [specific skills].

## Core Responsibilities
1. **Primary Task**: What this agent primarily does
2. **Secondary Tasks**: Supporting activities
3. **Quality Assurance**: How it ensures quality

## What You SHOULD Do
- Specific positive actions
- Expected behaviors
- Quality standards to maintain

## What You SHOULD NOT Do
- Boundaries and limitations
- Tasks for other agents
- Anti-patterns to avoid

## Available Tools
You have access to these tools:
- **Read**: For reading files
- **Write**: For creating files
- **Edit**: For modifying files
- **Task**: For spawning sub-agents (if orchestrator)
- [Other specific tools]

## Interaction Patterns
- How to communicate with users
- Output format specifications
- Progress reporting style

## Success Criteria
- Measurable outcomes
- Quality gates
- Performance targets
```

### Tool Configuration Guidelines

Agents should only have access to tools they need:

| Agent Type | Typical Tools | Restricted Tools |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Architect** | Read, Write, Grep | Bash, Edit (limited) |
| **Engineer** | All tools (*) | None (full access) |
| **Reviewer** | Read, Grep, Glob | Write, Edit, Bash |
| **Orchestrator** | Task, Read | Direct file editing |
| **Debugger** | Read, Bash, Edit | Write (new files) |

### Agent Categories

Organize agents by function:

1. **Core Agents** (Always needed)
   - System Architect: Design and specifications
   - Senior Engineer: Implementation
   - Code Reviewer: Quality assurance
   - Workflow Orchestrator: Multi-agent coordination

2. **Specialized Agents** (Domain-specific)
   - Database Specialist: Schema, queries, optimization
   - API Architect: Endpoint design, contracts
   - Security Auditor: Vulnerability scanning
   - Performance Engineer: Optimization

3. **Utility Agents** (Support functions)
   - Documentation Writer: Docs and comments
   - Test Engineer: Test creation and execution
   - Deployment Manager: CI/CD and releases

## Command Workflows

### The Feature-Loop Pattern

The `/feature-loop` command demonstrates optimal workflow design:

```markdown
# /feature-loop Command

## Purpose
Complete TDD feature development using parallel agents

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Parallel Analysis (3 agents)
All agents run SIMULTANEOUSLY:
- Architecture Agent: Design system structure
- Test Spec Agent: Create test specifications
- Research Agent: Find existing patterns

### Stage 2: Implementation & Review (2 agents)
Running in parallel:
- Implementation Agent: Write code (TDD style)
- Review Agent: Real-time quality checks

### Stage 3: Integration (1 agent)
- Integration Agent: Final validation
```

### Command Implementation

Commands use the Task tool to launch agents:

```javascript
// Parallel execution - all tasks in ONE message
<Task>
  <subagent_type>general-purpose</subagent_type>
  <description>Architecture design</description>
  <prompt>
    [Load agent persona from .claude-library/agents/architect.md]
    [Include relevant contexts]
    Design architecture for: {feature}
  </prompt>
</Task>
<Task>
  <subagent_type>general-purpose</subagent_type>
  <description>Test specifications</description>
  <prompt>
    [Load test engineer persona]
    Create comprehensive test specs for: {feature}
  </prompt>
</Task>
```

### Workflow Patterns

1. **Sequential Workflow**
   ```
   Architect → Engineer → Reviewer → Deploy
   ```
   Use when: Tasks depend on previous outputs

2. **Parallel Workflow**
   ```
   ┌─ Architect ─┐
   ├─ Tests ─────┼─→ Synthesis
   └─ Research ──┘
   ```
   Use when: Tasks are independent

3. **Hierarchical Workflow**
   ```
   Orchestrator
   ├─ Debug Team
   │   ├─ Frontend Debugger
   │   └─ Backend Debugger
   └─ Fix Team
       └─ Engineer
   ```
   Use when: Complex problems need decomposition

## Context Management

### Context Design Principles

Contexts provide shared knowledge without agent-specific instructions:

```markdown
# [Context Name]

## Overview
Brief description of what this context provides

## Key Information
- Data models
- API structures
- Configuration values
- Project patterns

## Code Examples
\`\`\`language
// Example implementations
\`\`\`

## Important Notes
- Gotchas
- Performance considerations
- Security requirements
```

### Dynamic Context Loading

Load contexts based on task requirements:

```javascript
function selectContexts(task) {
  const contexts = [];

  // Always load core context
  contexts.push('project.md');

  // Conditionally load specialized contexts
  if (task.includes('database')) {
    contexts.push('database-patterns.md');
  }
  if (task.includes('api')) {
    contexts.push('api-standards.md');
  }

  return contexts;
}
```

## Tool Configuration

### MCP Tools Integration

When using MCP tools, follow these guidelines:

1. **Prefer MCP tools** when available (they start with `mcp__`)
2. **Document tool access** in agent definitions
3. **Restrict dangerous operations** appropriately

Example MCP tool usage:
```markdown
## Available Tools
- `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`: Web navigation
- `mcp__playwright__browser_snapshot`: Page analysis
- `mcp__nuxt-ui-remote__get_component`: UI components
```

### Tool Restrictions

Define what agents should NOT do:

```markdown
## Tool Restrictions
- NEVER use `find` or `grep` commands (use Grep tool)
- NEVER use `cat` or `tail` (use Read tool)
- AVOID creating new files (prefer editing existing)
- NEVER commit without explicit user request
```

## Parallel Execution

### Leveraging Claude Code's Task Tool

The Task tool enables parallel agent execution:

```javascript
// WRONG - Sequential (slow)
await runAgent('architect');
await runAgent('test-writer');
await runAgent('researcher');

// RIGHT - Parallel (fast)
// Send all Tasks in ONE message
[
  Task('architect', prompt1),
  Task('test-writer', prompt2),
  Task('researcher', prompt3)
]
```

### Parallel Execution Benefits

| Execution Type | 3 Agents Time | 5 Agents Time | Efficiency |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| Sequential | 90 seconds | 150 seconds | Baseline |
| Parallel | 30 seconds | 30 seconds | 3-5x faster |

### When to Use Parallel Execution

**Good for Parallel:**
- Independent analysis tasks
- Multiple file searches
- Separate component development
- Different test types

**Keep Sequential:**
- Dependent tasks (output feeds next input)
- Progressive refinement
- Validation chains

## Best Practices

### 1. Agent Identity

Each agent needs clear identity:
```markdown
You are a [specific role] with expertise in [domain].
Your primary responsibility is [main task].
You excel at [specific skills].
```

### 2. Explicit Boundaries

Define what agents should NOT do:
```markdown
## What You Should NOT Do
- Create files unless absolutely necessary
- Make architectural decisions (that's for architect)
- Commit code without user approval
- Access production systems
```

### 3. Output Specifications

Standardize agent outputs:
```markdown
## Output Format
- Use markdown for documentation
- Include file paths as `path:line`
- Provide progress indicators
- Return structured data when possible
```

### 4. Error Handling

Define failure behaviors:
```markdown
## Error Handling
1. Identify the error type
2. Attempt automatic recovery if safe
3. Escalate to user with clear explanation
4. Suggest alternative approaches
```

### 5. Progress Reporting

Keep users informed:
```markdown
🏗️ Stage 1/3: Architecture Design
✅ Architecture complete
🏗️ Stage 2/3: Implementation
⏳ Writing code (60% complete)...
```

## Performance Optimization

### Context Reduction Strategies

1. **Minimal .claude folder** (< 10KB)
   - Only agent-launcher.md
   - Basic settings.json
   - Command shortcuts

2. **On-demand loading** from .claude-library
   - Agents loaded when needed
   - Contexts loaded based on task
   - Unload after completion

3. **Smart caching**
   - Cache frequently used agents
   - Reuse loaded contexts
   - Clear cache periodically

### Registry Optimization

Structure your REGISTRY.json for fast lookup:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "settings": {
    "auto_load_agents": false,
    "max_parallel_agents": 3,
    "cache_loaded_agents": true
  },
  "agents": {
    "architect": {
      "path": ".claude-library/agents/architect.md",
      "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Grep"],
      "triggers": ["design", "architecture", "spec"],
      "category": "core",
      "priority": 1
    }
  },
  "commands": {
    "feature": {
      "path": ".claude/commands/feature.md",
      "agents": ["architect", "engineer", "reviewer"],
      "workflow": "parallel-sequential"
    }
  }
}
```

### Workflow Optimization

1. **Batch operations**: Group similar tasks
2. **Parallel by default**: Unless dependencies exist
3. **Progressive loading**: Start with minimal context
4. **Early termination**: Stop on critical failures
